<h1 id="type-2-diabetes-the-management-of-type-2-diabetes">Type 2 diabetes: The management of type 2 diabetes</h1>
<p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a progressive long-term medical condition that is predominantly managed by the person with the diabetes and/or their carer as part of their daily life. Accordingly, understanding of diabetes, informed choice of management opportunities, and the acquisition of relevant skills for successful self-management play an important role in achieving optimal outcomes. Delivery of these needs is not always assured by conventional clinical consultations. Structured programmes have been designed not only to improve people s knowledge and skills, but also to help motivate and sustain people with diabetes in taking control of their condition and in delivering effective self-management.</p>
<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<p>The GDG noted that the last review of this area by a HTA on behalf of NICE in 2003 looked at the evidence for structured education. Little robust evidence of the effectiveness of any particular educational approach for people with Type 2 diabetes was found. One conclusion was that further research was required, but meanwhile that educational programmes with a theoretical basis demonstrated improved outcomes, and that group education was a more effective use of resources and may have additional benefits.</p>
<h2 id="offer-structured-education">Offer structured education</h2>
<p>Offer structured education to every person and/or their carer at and around the time of diagnosis, with annual reinforcement and review. Inform people and their carers that structured education is an integral part of diabetes care. ’</p>
<h3 id="evidence-statement-cg66es1">Evidence Statement CG66ES1</h3>
<p>Please refer to the Technology Assessment Report The clinical effectiveness of diabetes education models for Type 2 diabetes: a systematic review commissioned by the NHS R&amp;D Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme on behalf of the NCC-CC. Available at www.ncchta.org/project/1550.asp</p>
<p>Fibrates have a long and controversial history as lipid-lowering agents, beginning with clofibrate over 30 years ago and being implicated in the problems which led to withdrawal of cerivastatin in the 1990s. However, bezafibrate, fenofibrate and ciprofibrate have shown considerable staying power in the market. Statins have, however, eclipsed fibrates as primary cholesterol-lowering agents, so the issues surrounding fibrates relate to specific lipid abnormalities. In clinical practice these mostly concern hypertriglyceridaemia, itself strongly associated with low HDL-C levels, this problem being particularly common in people with Type 2 diabetes (more so than raised LDL-C levels). The clinical question then relates to whether and when a fibrate should be initiated before statin therapy, and the circumstances under which a fibrate should be added to, or substituted for, statin therapy</p>
<h3 id="discussion-1">Discussion</h3>
<p>While the evidence was not as strong as for the statins, there was convincing evidence of the effectiveness of fibrates in CV protection in people with Type 2 diabetes. Some of the trials (e.g. FIELD) in which this evidence was found included people with TG levels down to the upper end of the normal range (~1.8 mmol/l). However, while the price of fibrates was considerably above that of generic statins, the more effective fibrates as judged by TG lowering were about half the price of proprietary statins when both are used at standard doses. Hypertriglyceridaemia is a complex condition with both a genetic basis and often being secondary to other medical conditions, including poor blood glucose control. The GDG recognised it was not writing a guideline on management of hypertriglyceridaemia in people with Type 2 diabetes, but because of the interaction with blood glucose control and other medical conditions often associated with Type 2 diabetes (including renal impairment and liver disease), it could not avoid some general guidance in the area. In drawing up the recommendations the GDG was also cognisant of the need to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the likely combination with statin therapy (given its recommendations on statins) and the higher rate of side effects of combined usage</p></li>
<li><p>the more immediate risks of pancreatitis with higher levels of TGs</p></li>
<li><p>the difficulty of assessing LDL-C levels when TG levels were above 4.5 mmol/l. A useful pragmatic compromise was felt to be to base recommendations around cut-off levels of 2.3 and 4.5 mmol/l. There is evidence of differences between fibrates: gemfibrozil had greater interactions with other drugs commonly used in diabetes care; bezafibrate was cheaper and less effective in TG lowering and with a poorer CV evidence base than fenofibrate; and ciprofibrate was more poorly investigated. Therefore recommendations were based around fenofibrate, though with a role for bezafibrate where CV risk was less pronounced, and ciprofibrate as an alternative. Further information on fibrate statin combinations might become available when the ACCORD trial reports.35</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="when-to-perform-full-fasting-lipid-profile">When to perform full fasting lipid profile</h2>
<p>If there is a history of elevated serum triglycerides, perform a full fasting lipid profile (including HDL cholesterol and triglyceride estimations) when assessing cardiovascular risk annually. ’</p>
<p>Cholesterol lowering remained difficult, and indeed controversial, until the late 1980s when statins became available. Subsequently these drugs became the mainstay of lipid-lowering therapy, supported eventually by CV outcome studies. As discussed above, people with Type 2 diabetes are at high CV risk, and most of their morbidity and increased mortality comes from coronary, cerebral, and peripheral arterial disease. In earlier NICE technology appraisals (TAs) and the prior Type 2 diabetes guideline, statins were recommended for all people with extant CVD or at high risk thereof, states which include most people with Type 2 diabetes.283 Clinical questions which arise include whether more potent and more expensive statins should ever be used (and if so when), the use of statins in younger people with Type 2 diabetes, whether any people should not be routinely given statins, and the use of alternatives such as fibrates (addressed in the following fibrate section) and ezetimibe addressed by a 2007 NICE TA.2</p>
<h3 id="discussion-2">Discussion</h3>
<p>The GDG were cognisant of the previous NICE statin appraisal, the prior Type 2 diabetes guidelines, the ezetimibe appraisal, the deliberations of the NICE guidelines group on management of CVD, and the health economic analysis. The evidence of effectiveness and safety of generic statins, and in particular simvastatin seemed clear, and at current prices probably cost saving in the population with Type 2 diabetes over the age of 40 years (irrespective of experienceof CVD). There may be individuals in this group at lower CV risk (discussed in section 13), butthese people would be uncommon and easily identified by the absence of CV risk factors (see13.1.6). In others statin therapy should usually be with generic simvastatin at standard dosage(40 mg) in line with the prior TA283 and the Heart Protection Study. The group recognised that some people below the age of 40 years were also at high risk (10 year risk &gt;20%, or 20 year risk &gt;40%). It was considered that they would have to be identified by conventional risk factors; presence of features of the metabolic syndrome, strong family history, ethnic group, and evidence of microvascular damage such as nephropathy. Such people would then be treated with a statin, particularly as their 10-year risk horizon came to include 40 yearsof age or greater. However, the contraindication of the use of statins in pregnancy was felt to begreat enough to deserve special mention, for any woman of childbearing potential. The health economic analysis suggested titration to simvastatin 80 mg was highly cost-effective in those whose lipid levels were not controlled to target levels of 4.0/2.0 mmol/l (T-/LDL-C) irrespective of presence or absence of diagnosed CVD. In those with CVD the health economic analysis suggested that uptitration from simvastatin 80 mg to a more efficacious statin (modelled as atorvastatin 80 mg daily) was cost-effective if the titration targets were not met on the simvastatin.</p>
<h2 id="therapy-for-person-40-years-old-and-over">Therapy for person 40 years old and over</h2>
<p>For a person who is 40 years old or over: initiate therapy with generic simvastatin (to 40 mg) or a statin of similar efficacy and cost unless the cardiovascular risk from non-hyperglycaemia-related factors is low (see 1.9.1 ) if the cardiovascular risk from non-hyperglycaemia-related factors is low, assess cardiovascular risk using the UKPDS risk engine (see 1.9.2) and initiate simvastatin therapy (to 40 mg), or a statin of similar efficacy and cost, if the cardiovascular risk exceeds 20% over 10 years. ’</p>
<p>Abnormalities of blood lipid profiles, including serum HDL-C and TGs, are recognised CV riskfactors, and are particularly likely to be abnormal in people with Type 2 diabetes. Nicotinic acid preparations are one approach to improving lipid profiles. Nicotinic acid administration isassociated with side effects due to vasodilatation, and derivatives (acipimox) and modified-release preparations have been made available to try and reduce the problem. The clinical question is then what role nicotinic acid derivatives might have in the management of Type 2 diabetes.</p>
<h3 id="discussion-3">Discussion</h3>
<p>This group of drugs was not considered in the previous guideline (2002).414 The limitednumber of studies presented suggested that nicotinic acid can have some advantageous effect on serum HDL-C and lipids, but also that it has some negative effects on blood glucose control. In the absence of outcome trials in people with Type 2 diabetes, and given also the problems of using the current preparations (notably flushing despite prophylactic aspirin, dose titration and use of modified-release preparations), no general recommendation could be given for use of nicotinic acid. The group were aware of some possible special indications in people with extreme hypertriglyceridaemia, but felt this to be outside the remit of the current guideline.</p>
<h2 id="do-not-use-nicotinic-acid-preparations-routinely">Do not use nicotinic acid preparations routinely</h2>
<p>Do not use nicotinic acid preparations and derivatives routinely for people with type 2 diabetes.

<p>The concept of beneficial and harmful dietary fats has come to the fore in recent years. Some evidence does exist for the use of omega 3 fish oils in certain circumstances such as post-MI. The clinical question then was what role these oils might have in the management of people with Type 2 diabetes.</p>
<h3 id="discussion-4">Discussion</h3>
<p>From the evidence available fish oils as a homogeneous therapeutic concept is problematic, as the evidence included showed a variation in the fish oil dosage used. Clinical experience confirmed that large total doses of oils used to get an adequate dose of omega 3 fish oils in some preparations can cause adverse effects. From the evidence available omega 3 fish oil preparations could help lower TG levels, but overall showed minimal improvement in lipid profiles in people who had not had a MI. The GDG agreed there were financial consequences in prescribing omega 3 supplements when the evidence showed no clear benefit. It was recognised that the recommendations made must be understood as only applying for omega 3 fish oil supplementation, and not to recommendations on sources of dietary fats.</p>

<p>A subgroup analysis was undertaken with the hypertriglyceridaemic participants, doses of fish oil and trial duration. Hypertriglyceridaemic participants (control TGs &gt;4 mmol/l) An increased reduction in TGs was identified in trials (N=3) with only hypertriglyceridaemic participants; 1.45 mmol/l (2.89 to 0.01, p=0.05), compared with studies with non hypertriglyceridaemic participants (N=11) 0.40 mmol/l (0.61 to 0.19, p=0.0002). Increases in LDL-C levels were significant in the hypertriglyceridaemic groups (N=2 trials), 0.6 mmol/l (0.16 to 1.04, p=0.008), but they were NS in the non-hypertriglyceridaemic groups(N=9 trials).

<p>Antiplatelet therapy now has an established role in the management of people at high risk of cardiovascular (CV) events. People with Type 2 diabetes are known to have CV risk higher than matched populations after allowance for other CV risk factors, and in some studies as high as those without diabetes who have declared cardiovascular disease (CVD).273 National guidelines and the previous NICE (inherited) Type 2 diabetes guideline recommend use of aspirin in people at high CV risk.319,320 Other antiplatelet agents (clopidogrel and dipyridamole modified release (MR)) have been the subject of a NICE technology appraisal (TA) but without specific calculation for the higher CV event rate or the specific risk reduction in people with Type 2 diabetes.321 The increasing occurrence of Type 2 diabetes in younger people raises the additional question of the use of antiplatelet therapy in those who CV risk may be not be very high. The guidelines are not concerned with the use of antiplatelet therapy after acute cardiological events or cardiac interventions, or after acute cerebrovascular events. The clinical question then is whether antiplatelet medications should be used in people with Type 2 diabetes, or in which subgroups of such people, and if so which agents and in what doses.</p>
<h3 id="discussion-5">Discussion</h3>
<p>Little extra evidence of note on use of aspirin was available since the last review. However, there is now better understanding of the extent of the CV risk faced by people with Type 2 diabetes. The rather poor direct evidence for people with Type 2 diabetes led to difficulties in assessing the level of risk above which aspirin therapy should be advised. The GDG accepts that its view that all people at, or over, the age of 50 years should treated is somewhat arbitrary. Primary prevention below that age would be by assessment of higher CV risk (family history of premature vascular disease, abnormal lipid profile, marked abdominal adiposity). While thegroup were aware of some discussions over the dose of aspirin to be used in people withdiabetes, they were not presented with any evidence that could lead to a variation from the usual national recommendations of 75 mg.NICE guidance for dipyridamole MR related only to people with cerebrovascular events. The evidence for the use of clopidogrel was noted to relate to acute and non-acute situations. The current guideline review was not concerned with acute vascular events or interventions. The CHARISMA and MATCH trials suggested that the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel carried a significant side-effect risk of a serious nature not balanced by secure health gain, and therefore could not be generally recommended. NICE guidance for secondary prevention of vascular events in people without diabetes was that clopidogrel should not be used instead of aspirin except where intolerance or hypersensitivity to the latter was present. The specific evidence for people with diabetes, mostly sub-analyses, did not suggest that advice should be varied for people with Type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>Diabetes eye damage is the single largest cause of blindness before old age with a progressive incidence in people with Type 2 diabetes.346 The success of laser therapy in the treatment of sight-threatening retinopathy is an accepted part of ophthalmological care and has not been assessed for this guideline. Appropriate clinical questions to be addressed are, however, how people with developing retinopathy can be selected for ophthalmological referral in time for optimal treatment, and whether preventative therapy other than good blood glucose, good blood pressure, and good blood lipid control can be useful in people with Type 2 diabetes.</p>
<h3 id="discussion-7">Discussion</h3>
<p>It was noted that management in this area was largely determined by practice for all people with diabetes and not just those with Type 2 diabetes. Indeed retinopathy screening programmes to be provided on a local community basis were a key early target of the National Service Framework (NSF) for diabetes, and since that time the UK National Screening Programme has published and updated a workbook on Essential elements in developing a diabetic retinopathy screening programme for the guidance of health authorities and primary care trusts in England (fourth edition, January 2007).347 These observations, and a lack of awareness amongst experts of new publications that might affect recommendations on retinopathy screening, led to the conclusion that recommendations for people with Type 2 diabetes should closely follow those for Type 1 diabetes (NICE guideline 2004),26 which themselves were largely based on generic evidence independent of type of diabetes. Accordingly the recommendations of the Type 1 diabetes guidelines, and the evidence statements underlying them were reviewed, together with the national screening document. There are no significant changes from the Type 1 diabetes recommendations.</p>

<p>Neuropathic pain is a troublesome symptom of chronic exposure to poor blood glucose control that cannot be managed acutely by restoration of blood glucose control. It can take many forms, and is often distressing and sometimes depressing, particularly if symptoms are predominantly nocturnal and disturb sleep. People with diabetes may be reluctant to report the symptoms to those with expertise in diabetes care, because of lack of awareness that the problem is diabetes related. A number of drug and non-drug approaches to management are available, this diversity reflecting that none of them are fully effective. Clinically the issues are when to start specific drug therapy for neuropathic pain, which medications to use, and in what order to try them.</p>
<h3 id="discussion-8">Discussion</h3>
<p>A more holistic approach was often needed at discovery of the problem in helping people tounderstand it, where secondary psychological problems occurred, and when onward referral was needed to specialist pain teams for lack of response to conventional measures.</p>

<p>Make a formal enquiry annually about the development of neuropathic symptoms causing distress.

<p>Gastroparesis can be one of the more devastating complications of autonomic neuropathy. While it can present as bloating, nausea and fullness on eating, severe intermittent hypoglycaemia can be a major problem for people on glucose-lowering therapy, while vomiting may be intermittent and sudden or occasionally severe and protracted. The clinical questions addressed include in whom to suspect gastroparesis might be present, what medications might help, and what other measures might be taken.</p>
<h3 id="discussion-9">Discussion</h3>
<p>The evidence reported had methodological limitations, notably studies of small sample sizes.The GDG agreed that there is a poor evidence base for the treatment of gastroparesis. Nevertheless they noted that the evidence reported suggested that the prokinetic drugs, metoclopramide, domperidone, along with erythromycin, were all effective in at least some people with gastroparesis resulting from autonomic neuropathy. On consideration of the evidence it was not possible to distinguish usefully between the prokinetic drugs. The group agreed that choice of initial therapy should be based on tolerability issues, including drug interactions. It was noted that differential diagnosis can be difficult, and the diagnostic tests not secure, while serious prolonged vomiting could become a medical emergency. Accordingly referral beyond diabetes services is sometimes indicated. While the group gave priority to medication for the management of this condition, clinical experience suggested that non-pharmacological approaches including postural advice and timing of ingestion of fluids and solids could prove useful to some people.</p>

<p>All people with Type 2 diabetes should be supported to:try to achieve and maintain blood glucose levels and blood pressure in the normal rangeor as close to normal as is safely possible, maintain a lipid and lipoprotein profile that reduces the risk of vascular disease. Optimal dietary behaviours can contribute to all of these. Dietary intervention should address the individual s nutritional needs, taking into account personal choices, cultural preferences and willingness to change, and to ensure that quality of life is optimised. It is usual that a registered dietician plays a key role in providing nutritional care advice within the multidisciplinary diabetes team. It is also recognised that all team members need to be knowledgeable about nutritional therapy, and give emphasis to consistent dietary and lifestyle advice.11</p>
<h3 id="discussion-10">Discussion</h3>
<p>The GDG noted that there was little new evidence to warrant any change to previous views in this field. The major consensus-based recommendations from the UK and USA emphasise sensible practical implementation of nutritional advice for people with Type 2 diabetes. Other relevant NICE guidance should be considered where relevant, including clinical guideline no. 43 on the assessment and management of overweight and obesity in adults and children and clinical guideline no. 48 which gives dietary and lifestyle advice post-MI. Overlap with the NICE/RCP Type 1 diabetes guideline was noted. Management otherwise will concentrate on principles of healthy eating (essentially those for optimal cardiovascular risk protection), and reduction of high levels of free carbohydrate in food that are hyperglycaemic in the presence of defective insulin secretory reserve.</p>

<p>Barnard et al.14 investigated the effects of a low-fat vegan diet compared with a diet based on ADA guidelines, on body weight and glycaemic control in an RCT with 99 Type 2 diabetics, followed up for 22 weeks. During the study period, 43% (21/49) of vegan participants and 26% (13/50) of ADA participants reduced their diabetic medications, mainly as a result of hypoglycaemia. Eight per cent in each group, 4/49 of the vegan group and 4/50 of the ADA group, increased their medications. The study concluded that for the whole sample, body weight was reduced in both groups by 5.8 kg in the vegan group and 4.3 kg in the ADA group, but this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.082).

<p>The risk of arterial disease and microvascular complications in people with diabetes are known to be related to the extent of hyperglycaemia with time. While the lifestyle, oral agent, and injectable therapies discussed in this guideline can improve blood glucose control, their efficacy is limited, as the underlying pathogenesis of diabetes worsens with time. As symptoms are not a reliable guide to blood glucose control in people on therapy, it is important to have an accurate means of measuring blood glucose control over time, to enable decision-making. This section addresses the clinical questions as to the tests of blood glucose control best predictive of future vascular damage from diabetes, the nature of the relationship between test results and such vascular risk, how tests should be deployed in clinical practice, and how they might be interpreted.</p>

<p>The UKPDS included an analysis of intensive blood glucose control with metformin for overweight patients compared to conventional treatment primarily with diet. The study included 753 overweight (&gt;120% ideal body weight) patients with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes from 15 hospital-based clinics in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Of these patients 342 were allocated to an intensive blood glucose control policy with metformin and 411 were allocated to conventional treatment, primarily with diet alone.

<p>Self-monitoring is the only direct method by which a person with diabetes can be aware of their level of control of blood glucose. It has utility when used with therapies of erratic effect, those requiring considerable dose adjustment (notably insulin), and in those whose therapies put them at risk of hypoglycaemia. More controversial, except for people using insulin, is the use of self-monitoring to provide feedback on the impact of lifestyle measures on blood glucose control, and as part of the overall educational package designed to enhance self-care. Indirect monitoring using urine glucose tests is cheaper, but also delivers less information than plasma glucose monitoring. This section addresses the clinical question of the role of self-monitoring of plasma glucose in people at different stages of the condition and on different therapies, and its integration with other key processes of care such as patient education.</p>
<h3 id="discussion-12">Discussion</h3>
<p>The newer meta-analyses did not add significantly to the views expressed in the previous Type 2 diabetes guideline. The findings of the ROSSO study44 and the data from the large Kaiser Permanente cohorts 43 added considerable confidence to the view that SMBG was an integral part of effective patient education packages and enabled the effective use of many other therapies and lifestyle interventions. The view in the previous guideline that self-monitoring of plasma glucose is not a stand-alone intervention was endorsed. Concern was expressed over a number of issues surrounding the successful use of selfmonitoring, and recognised that its cost meant that it had to be effectively deployed. It should only be supported in the context of a provision of a package of care, including structured education, from a primary or secondary diabetes care team. The initial education should be provided by a properly trained and skilled professional with understanding of the problems of the technology. Also, the skills of people with diabetes in using the technology should be the subject of regular quality assurance (together with the devices) perhaps as part of the regular annual review process. Devices should be calibrated to plasma glucose levels in line with 2006 WHO recommendations.</p>

<p>None of the newer evidence altered the priority given to metformin cited in the previous guideline. Although the specific cardioprotective effects of metformin suggested by the UKPDS study were open to challenge from some of the very recent studies, this was not on the basis of strong outcome data. Large observational studies from Canada and Scotland111,112 appeared to support the widespread advantage of metformin over sulfonylureas, but the A Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial (ADOPT) study did not. The cardioprotective gains shown in the UKPDS andin the Scottish study far outweighed the concerns over lactic acidosis (provided renal function was adequate) in people with mild to moderate hepatic and cardiac disease. Nearly all the data related to overweight people, and there was little to guide metformin use in the normal weight person without extrapolation of the evidence. However, the overwhelming majority of people with Type 2 diabetes are overweight; in making this judgement however attention has to be paid to differences between ethnic groups.</p>

<p>The evidence base for the insulin secretagogues was more extensive than ascertained for the parent guideline. However, in many of the papers in which they are compared to other drugs they were being used as the comparator therapy rather than the investigated therapy. New evidence did not lead to new conclusions about the role of these drugs in clinical management, either from the point of view of efficacy or safety. Sulfonylureas proved as efficacious as newer comparator therapies in reducing surrogate outcomes (principally HbA1c) highlighting that they still have a role in modern management of Type 2 diabetes. In the ADOPT study54 the sulfonylurea glibenclamide controlled HbA1c as effectively as rosiglitazone or metformin as monotherapy for the first 3 years, but persistence of glucose control after this time was worse. Cardiovascular outcomes were, if anything, better with the sulfonylurea.</p>

<p>Insulin was previously normally delivered from syringes, necessitating accurate measuring of insulin doses drawn up from insulin vials under suitably hygienic conditions. Modern peninjector devices obviate most of the problems of measuring up doses while avoiding most of the hygiene problems, and offer a convenient and safe means of carrying around injectionequipment. However, several models of injector are available, including some designed for those with visual and physical impairments. The clinical question addressed here was whether any particular pen-injector had an evidencebased advantage over any other, including groups of people with difficulty using such devices.</p>
<h3 id="discussion-16">Discussion</h3>
<p>There was no strong published evidence that insulin pen injectors were a preferred option forinsulin injection, but in clinical practice this was not questionable. The studies comparing devices did not compare all devices, were inevitably unblinded, and were manufacturer sponsored in single centres for the most part. The issue of bias was real. It was considered thatsome devices preformed better than others, but also that this was generally known to regular prescribers. Prescribers should be fully familiar with the devices they were recommending; this would be difficult for all the devices available. One injection device, the InnoLet, was not a pen injector, but was aimed more at people withphysical disabilities in manipulating injection systems. The studies were consistent with clinical experience in suggesting that this device was successful in enabling self-injection in somepeople who could not otherwise do it easily or reliably. Please refer to the Diabetes UK guidance for the issue of disposal of devices/sharps.</p>
<h2 id="education-for-those-requiring-insulin-via-injection-device">Education for those requiring insulin via injection device</h2>

<p>People with Type 2 diabetes are at high cardiovascular (CV) risk, high risk of diabetes eye damage, and high risk of renal disease. These adverse outcomes are known to be reduced by improved blood pressure (BP) control, which can be used to lower the risk of stroke, MI, blindness and renal failure.226 Some other forms of diabetes microvascular damage, including peripheral nerve damage, are known to be associated with higher BP.227 BP lowering is likely to be highly cost-effective in people with Type 2 diabetes, more so than in the general population. A number of clinical questions then face the person with diabetes and their advisors, these include: at what levels of BP to initiate therapy whether, and to what extent, those levels should be influenced by particular risk factors(in particular those involved in renal disease) what level of BP to aim for, and whether that should be modified by the presence of renal, eye, or macrovascular damage, what lifestyle measure are effective and cost-effective in lowering BP what pharmacological interventions are effective and cost-effective in BP lowering how choice of agent might be modified by the presence of end organ damage. Lifestyle measures (explored elsewhere) and monotherapy medication are known to have limited efficacy in lowering BP. Additional clinical questions arise over: the combinations of medications to be used after first-line therapy considerations including synergies of action, side effects of some combinations, and cost.</p>
<h3 id="discussion-17">Discussion</h3>
<p>The GDG noted the problems in assigning BP lowering targets in this area, and in particular the problem setting a cut-off where the evidence suggests the lower the blood pressure the better (without adverse effects) difficulties of achieving any reasonable target in some people individual targets that should logically vary with individual risk arbitrary dichotomy that arises immediately above and below any target level. The results of some RCTs suggested that SBP well into the normal range (below usual target values) was both achievable and associated with benefit in people with Type 2 diabetes, consistent with epidemiological evidence from other studies. In some other studies tight BP control seemed difficult to achieve, consistent with the groups clinical experience. This led the group to take a simple risk approach centered on a target level of &lt;140/80 mmHg for most people with Type 2 diabetes, and &lt;130/80 mmHg for those at more particular risk. The latter group included people with raised albumin excretion rate (AER) (microalbuminuria or worse), eGFR &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2, those with retinopathy, and those with prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). The concern that more active prevention was being targeted at those who had already developed end-organ damage was recognised, but it was noted that for both microalbuminuria (chapter 16) and early retinopathy (chapter 17) the recommendations on annual surveillance meant that markers of damage would be detected many years before ill health ensued.</p>

<p>In summary, A2RB therapy was associated with greater benefits for Type 2 diabetes patients in terms of renal outcomes (e.g. progression to ESRD, doubling of serum creatinine, proteinuria) than treatment with placebo, CCB or sympatholytic agents. In addition, treatment with A2RB was also associated with a better metabolic and BP profile than sympatholytic therapy but nonsignificant differences were observed over those treated with CCB.</p>

<p>Nearly all people with Type 2 diabetes are at high cardiovascular (CV) risk high enough to justify statin therapy without further assessment.273 Others are at more extreme risk.273 Other therapies in addition to cholesterol-modifying drugs used to ameliorate CV risk include blood glucose lowering, blood pressure (BP) lowering, and anti-platelet therapies (see recommendations in these areas), together with lifestyle measures. Logically the intensity with which these therapies are used should be determined in part by the level of risk. To a limited extent this can be assessed clinically by summation of presence of risk factors (high waist circumference, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level, HbA1c, BP, smoking, family history of premature vascular disease, ethnic group, abnormal serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride (TG)) or the presence of particular risk factors (microalbuminuria, previous CV event). However, many of these variables are continuous distributions so it makes sense to ask whether tools are available that make full use of the data which could be made available from their measurement. As diabetes itself is a risk factor, any such approach would have to be diabetes specific. The clinical questions addressed were whether any risk calculator (risk engine) or risk chart, specifically designed for people with diabetes, gave valid and useful assessments of CV risk in people with diabetes, and in what circumstances they might be used.</p>
<h3 id="discussion-18">Discussion</h3>
<p>The UKPDS risk engine and to a lesser extent the older JBS-2 charts had some evidence of validity in people with Type 2 diabetes, at least once over the age of 40 years. However, in their latest revision JBS-2 charts for people with Type 2 diabetes are not available. Other estimations based on the Framingham population were not reliable, and the reasons for this were understood. No system included all the desirable variables, with the exception of Archimedes, but this was not intended as a clinical tool. It was noted that a wide range of epidemiological studies suggested that people with diabeteswere over twice as likely as the background population (age and sex matched) to develop CVD, and that many had confounding factors (such as use of antihypertensive or glucose-lowering medications) which prevented use of calculators. Studies such as the UK validation analysis reported above were clearly not consistent epidemiologically with UK populations at diagnosis, and furthermore excluded people already on therapy, and are therefore not reliable as a means of estimating the size of the population justifying therapy except for comparing tools. The group concluded that the normal approach, once age was considered, of managing nearly all people with Type 2 diabetes as having risk &gt;20%/10-years was appropriate, particularly as outcome from MI is known to be worse for those with diabetes, and preventative therapy therefore more cost effective. Particular concerns were also expressed by the GDG over people with microalbuminuria, those with more extreme family histories of CVD, and those with previous and recurrent CV events. This and the age problem meant that it was recognised that any risk estimation had a limited role. However, the GDG were also concerned that some people with Type 2 diabetes do not have the classical phenotype of the disease with abdominal adiposity (or obesity) and low HDL-C. It was concerned that such people should be recognised at diagnosis and managed more conservatively.</p>

<p>Nearly all people with Type 2 diabetes are at high cardiovascular (CV) risk. Epidemiologicallythat excess risk is independently associated with their hyperglycaemia together with high blood pressure (BP) and dyslipidaemia, the last typically the low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and raised triglyceride (TG) levels found as components of the metabolic syndrome.280 Studies have suggested that people with Type 2 diabetes without declared cardiovascular disease (CVD) are at as high a risk of a CVD event as someone without diabetes with declared CVD.273 While this is disputed by other studies, it still leaves individuals with Type 2 diabetes as nearly always in the high CVD risk category, and accordingly it has been usual to manage them actively as if for secondary rather than primary prevention of CVD. Nevertheless, in a few people with Type 2 diabetes the clinical phenotype is not that associated with high CV risk, albeit these people being generally remarkable for not being overweight nor having features of the metabolic syndrome, and being insulin sensitive. More importantly people with Type 2 diabetes who have declared CVD are at much higher risk (&gt;1.5 2.6) of further events or CV death as people with CVD without diabetes.273 Such extreme risk would appear to justify more intensive management than usually offered to someone who has, for example, had a heart attack. The management of CV risk through glucose lowering, BP lowering, and anti-platelet therapy is dealt with elsewhere in this guideline. This chapter deals with lipid-lowering therapy; dietary modification also being dealt with in a separate chapter. Paradoxically, although low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are not particularly raised in people with Type 2 diabetes compared to the background population, the opportunity to lower risk through lipid management is currently greatest through drugs which lower LDL-C, principally the statins.Nevertheless, a variety of other lipid modifying drugs are available and will be considered in turn.</p>
<h3 id="discussion-19">Discussion</h3>
<p>The GDG reviewed the evidence, and their clinical experience of trying to manage the complexities of CV risk in clinical practice. They recognised the primacy of trying to control risk cost effectively against treating-to-target, but also noted the practical utility of measurements in assessing response to therapies and providing motivation to people with diabetes. Ultimately theissue of cost effectiveness could only be resolved in the context of the interventions being used to modify the lipid profile, and the evidence in this area was therefore subsumed into the recommendations on the use of CV risk estimation, statins and fibrates.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-perform-full-lipid-profile">When to perform full lipid profile</h2>
<p>Perform a full lipid profile (including high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol and triglyceride estimations) when assessing cardiovascular risk after diagnosis and annually, and before starting lipid-modifying therapy. ’</p>

<p>The lipid-lowering therapy meta-analysis showed that the RR reductions were similar for both primary and secondary prevention.282 However, the average absolute risk reduction was more than twice as high for those with coronary artery disease (secondary prevention) than for those without it (primary prevention). Primary prevention trials fixed effects analysis due to level of heterogeneity (p=0.18). The pooled RR for CV events with lipid-lowering therapy was 0.78 (0.67 to 0.89), with number needed to be treated (NNT) for benefit of 34.5 (for 4.3 years). Secondary prevention analysis random effects analysis as there was substantial between study heterogeneity (p=0.03). The pooled RR for CV events with lipid-lowering therapy was similar to that for primary prevention 0.76 (0.59 to 0.93), with NNT for benefit for of 13.8 (for 4.9 years). The authors concluded that target cholesterol levels and the effectiveness of dose titration (or the use of multiple agents) have not been rigorously examined. Most studies compared a lipid lowering drug with placebo but did not evaluate the effect of reaching specific cholesterol levels. Level 1++</p>

<p>This double-blind study over 12 months compared the combination of extended-release fluvastatin 80 mg and fenofibrate 200 mg and the monotherapy of fenofibrate 20 mg, N=48 participants.295 At 6 months the combination showed a significantly higher reduction in LDL-C compared with fenofibrate monotherapy. For the 12-month point significantly there were greater reductions in LDL-C and TG levels and increases in HDL-C with the combination group compared with the monotherap. Adverse events No serious AEs were reported, N=3 discontinued in the study due to myalgia. Level 1++</p>

<p>This multicentre study incorporated both a double-blind, fixed-dose phase and an open-label titrating dose phase, N=216.297 Fixed dose: the 6-week fixed-dose phase had placebo, rosuvastatin 5 mg and rosuvastatin 10 mg groups. There were significant decreases for both rosuvastatin 5 mg and 10 mg groups compared with increases with placebo in TC (36.6%, 31.4% vs 1.1%, p&lt;0.001) and TGs (24.5%, 29.5% vs 4.7%, p&lt;0.001) and compared with decreases in LDL-C levels with placebo (40.7%, 45.8% vs 0.6%, p&lt;0.001). At week 6, 77.4% of those in the rosuvastatin 10 mg group had reached the LDL-C goal of &lt;100 mg/dl, compared with 8.3% of those receiving placebo.

<p>This study compared gemfibrozil 1,200 mg compared with simvastatin 20 mg, N=70.300 This study did not complete comparisons between the groups, both treatments significantly decreased TC and TG levels, and increased HDL-C compared with the baseline. There were significant decreases in LDL-C with simvastatin compared with baseline but not with gemfibrozil. There were small numbers of incidents of GI events with gemfibrozil and generalised weakness and muscle pain with simvastatin. Level 1+</p>

<p>This double-blind, multicentre study with N=268 participants compared gemfibrozil 1,200 mg and pravastatin matched placebo with pravastatin 40 mg and gemfibrozil matched placebo. Lipids There were significantly greater reductions in TC and LDL-C with pravastatin than with gemfibrozil. Conversely there was a significantly greater reduction in TG levels with gemfibrozil than with pravastatin p&lt;0.001. Changes in HDL-C were NS between the groups. Adverse events The AEs reported were considered not severe and the most frequent were GI related (N=28 gemfibrozil and N=24 pravastatin). Level 1++</p>
