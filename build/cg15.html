<h1 id="type-1-diabetes">Type 1 Diabetes</h1>
<p>Diabetes is a group of disorders with a number of features in common, of which raised blood sugar is the most evident. This guideline is concerned only with type 1 diabetes, a condition that aetiologically is a pure hormone-deficiency disease. However, because hormone replacement with insulin therapy is sub-optimal, acute and long-term complications are endemic despite the implementation of lifestyle and other disease management measures.</p>
<h2 id="topic-cg15adults15">Topic CG15AdultS15</h2>
<p>People with Type 1 diabetes are generally recognised to be at greatly increased risk of arterial disease (CVD) in middle age. While the literature on arterial risk factors and markers in the general population is large, it would not appear to follow that the findings can be simply carried ov er to people with Type 1 diabetes. Similarly, the tools used to quantify arterial risk in the general population are known not to work well in people with Type 2 diabetes, and seem even less likely to be valid in Type 1 diabetes.</p>
<p>The group recognised the very considerable difficulties in reaching conclusions from the ev idence in this area. Very little direct information pertaining to people with Type 1 diabetes can be ascertained, whilst the importance of the issue is emphasised by the very high early arterial disease (CVD) risk run by people with Type 1 diabetes. Nevertheless certain sub-groups are known to be at particularly high risk (people with raised albumin excretion rate (micro- albuminuria)), while others combine Type 1 diabetes with combinations of classic risk factors ty pical of the metabolic syndrome and known to be predictors of high arterial risk in people w ith Type 2 diabetes and indeed non-diabetic po pulations. A further group of people will co mbine Type 1 diabetes with a single arterial risk factor or risk marker, while yet others will have Type 1 diabetes but appear low risk otherwise. Ac co r dingly the important factors for surveillance are urinary albumin excretion (most important), other classical risk factors including full lipid profile, and risk markers such as age, family history and some ethnic groups. In accordance with the principle of unified organisation of care, monitoring of these factors annually is to be recommended, but it was recognised that in low risk individuals technology might become capable of programming longer review intervals for serum lipids. The group recognised that different ways of using information from a full lipid profile (calculated LDL and HDL separately, calculation of total: HDL cholesterol ratio, calculation of non-HDL cholesterol) are in use. While the group preferred the first of these as not mixing lipid abnormalities of different pathogenesis, and being a better route to using the treatments for different lipid disorders rationally, it was recog nised that there was not good evidence to suggest supporting one approach over the others. The group could find no confidence in any risk table, engine or equation when applied to people with Type 1 diabetes.</p>

However, one study in the review demonstrated that risk-based algorithms which directly incorporate age, other risk factors and measures of total and HDL cholesterol are the most accurate approach to screening. These processes are difficult to access and so supplemental tables, such as the Sheffield table, can improve the feasibility of a risk-based strategy</p>

<p>Prevention of arterial risk in people with Type 1 diabetes, through attention to blood glucose co ntrol (insulin therapy, patient education, nutrit ion, self-monitoring) is considered elsewhere in this guideline, and blood pressure management in 8.3, below. However, in the general population (at much lower risk) and in people with Type 2 diabetes other therapies are known to re duce the risk of arterial events. The current section therefore deals with these approaches as applied to people with Type 1 diabetes.</p>
<p>The data on arterial risk management in people with Type 1 diabetes are few, though it is noted that studies in people with and without Type 2 diabetes point to clinically effective interventions for those groups. In the absence of quantitative risk assessment and noting the economic evidence placed before the group it seemed clear that interventions in people with Ty pe 1 diabetes must be recommended considering their semi-quantitative arterial disease risk: high, moderate or no risk. Given the high arterial risk of many people with Type 1 diabetes, smoking was considered to be particularly disadvantageous.</p>
<p>advice on smoking cessation Adults with Type 1 diabetes who smoke should be given advice on smoking cessation and use of smoking cessation services, including NICE guidance-recommended therapies. The messages should be reinforced in continuing smokers yearly if pre-contemplative of stopping, and at all clinical contacts if there is a prospect of their stopping. ’</p>

<p>Fo r evidence relating specifically to people with diabetes the North of England guidelines 188 identified eight trials contributing to an overall estimate of risk difference for arterial morbidity of 1.2% with aspirin compared to placebo or other antiplatelet agent. These trials were homogeneous with a pooled incidence rate differen ce (by random effects model) of a 0.3% re duction in the risk of MI, stroke or vascular death from antiplatelet therapy for one year. This is not a statistically significant difference, and in summary authors state that aspirin given to patients with diabetes appears to have a small and statistically uncertain effect upon the risk of ex periencing a subsequent vascular event. They also suggest that the similar relative risk for MI, stroke and vascular death found in diabetes trials and other trials of patients at raised vascular r isk, indicates that patients with diabetes alongside other indications of vascular risk are likely to benefit from routine aspirin therapy</p>

<p>A predefined subgroup analysis of 3,577 people over 55 with diabetes (the majority of whom had Type 2 diabetes) in the large multinational HOPE randomised controlled trial 191 showed the effect of ramipril on arterial outcomes in people with diabetes. The rate of combined primary outcome of MI, stroke or arterial death was significantly lower in the ramipril groups than in those receiving placebo. Total mortality was reduced by 24%. Adjustment for changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressures did not change the magnitude of the effect</p>

<p>Other results from the HOPE study 192 in which patients aged over 55 years, with and without diabetes, who were randomised to receive 400 IU vitamin E for an average follow-up of 4.5 years, showed no effect of antioxidant over placebo. Primary outcomes of MI, stroke or arterial death, or secondary outcomes of hospitalisations for angina or heart failure, were similar following tr eatment with vitamin E and placebo. No differences were observed in the frequency of outcomes in people with diabetes in the two treatment groups</p>

<p>W hilst economic analyses have been conducted on trials of lipid-lowering agents, no evaluation has specifically considered Type 1 diabetes. Three papers were identified within the health economic literature dealing with mixed diabetic populations. 35052 An economic analysis 350 of simvastatin using the 4S trial data suggests that it would provide cost-effective mortality re duction in the UK amongst a similar population. A second cost-effectiveness paper 351 also suggests that the simvastatin may be cost-effective in the UK for those aged 40 to 70 years with elevated cholesterol even if they have not been diagnosed with arterial disease. A third paper based outside the UK suggests that the benefits of simvastatin to diabetics with elevated lipid levels and arterial disease outweigh the benefit to those with elevated lipid levels and no prior arterial disease. 352</p>

<p>The diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes would not appear to present any problems. It is, however, a lifelong condition requiring treatment with a therapy of considerable health and social impact (insulin injections) so it is important that the diagnosis is secure. Considerations also arise over differentiating the types of diabetes.</p>
<p>The group endorsed the commentary discussed above, and concluded that simple recommendations were all that were required. Although in this condition diagnosis of diabetes is rarely in doubt, errors do arise in attribution of diabetes type on occasions, and this is known to result in negative consequences including failure to anticipate ketoacidosis or unnecessary insulin therapy. Accordingly the group felt that cautionary recommendations were in order. The group noted that formal evidence of the utility of tests to distinguish type of diabetes by auto-immune markers or measures of islet B-cell function was not positive, and that these tests were not routinely performed. The group were keen to reiterate the importance of laboratory glucose estimation in line with WHO recommendations to avoid the very rare misdiagnoses with lifelong consequences. The25 role of symptoms and of HbA1c estimation were seen as useful but only supportive, as both lack absolute specificity.</p>
<p>Confirming diabetes Diabetes should be confirmed by a single diagnostic laboratory glucose measurement in the presence of classical symptoms, or by a further laboratory glucose measurement. The diagnosis may be supported by a raised HbA1c ’</p>
<h3 id="evidence-statement-cg15adultes1">Evidence Statement CG15AdultES1</h3>
<p>Diagnosis, in regard of types of diabetes, is generally not addressed by the WHO report.8 That report notes that children present with severe symptoms, and that diagnosis is simply confirmed by blood glucose measurement (advice that may be regarded as dated)</p>

<h3 id="evidence-statement-cg16adultes2">Evidence Statement CG16AdultES2</h3>
<p>WHO otherwise concentrates mainly on the situation pertaining to Type 2 diabetes, in doing so noting (by reference to the 1985 report) the lack of need for challenge testing when plasma glucose levels are high in the absence of other metabolic stress, and are confirmed by a second laboratory measurement or classic symptoms.</p>
<h2 id="topic-cg15adults2">Topic CG15AdultS2</h2>
<p>The management of diabetes is multidimensional, and each dimension is multifaceted. Notable dimensions include diagnosis and associated management, preventative long-term care, hospital and emergency management, and detection and management of late-developing complications. With each of these dimensions a number of care areas are found (for example in long-term prevention, glucose control, blood pressure control, risk factor surveillance, blood lipid control and smoking), and for each care area a number of deliverables addressed (for example in blood glucose control: knowledge and basis of targets, injection skills, selfmonitoring, dose adjustment, dietary matching, hypoglycaemia management, sick day management) by a number of different members of a multidisciplinary team. This multidimensional care delivery requirement has spawned diverse attempts aimed at ensuring optimal care is available to all those with diabetes. This section of the guideline seeks to examine what evidence is available to support some of these approaches.</p>
<p>The group endorsed the approaches suggested by the evidence, but noted that attempts to implement some of the recommendations in the past had been inhibited by funding difficulties.This however was not felt to be a barrier to reiterating the health gains to be obtained. It was noted that recent publications (beyond the cut-off date of the searches) supported some of the recommendations further, including those relating to specialist nurses. The UKs national service framework for diabetes was noted to have endorsed diabetes registers. The group recognised the lack of any kind of formal evidence relating to walk-in, telephone-request and out-of-hours services.</p>
<p>Multidisciplinary teams provide advice Advice to adults with Type 1 diabetes should be provided by a range of professionals with skills in diabetes care working together in a coordinated approach. A common environment (diabetes centre) is an important resource in allowing a diabetes multidisciplinary team to work and communicate efficiently while providing consistent advice. ’</p>

<p>Most papers in this area are descriptive, and there is inevitable overlap with deployment of multidisciplinary teams and provision of diabetes information and foot care.

<p>Two potentially useful papers consider the type of treatment facility used to deliver care to those with Type 1 diabetes.334,335 One German study334 found that the treatment facility (polyclinics, specialist clinics or general practitioners) makes no difference to diabetes-specific knowledge when this was controlled for age, sex and education. One UK study335 found no difference between hospital- and general practice-based care on a range of outcome measures for metabolic control, satisfaction with treatment or beliefs about diabetic control for a mixed diabetic population. Some differences were observed in the surveillance for complications, with more frequent testing in integrated care. Whilst costly, it is worth noting that fewer patients defaulted from general practice-based care than conventional care. Avoided complications may offset the increased cost of general practice-based care, although this cannot be established on the basis of this study. One UK-based study297 suggested that the provision of a hospital-based diabetes specialist nurse lowered the cost per patient admission without producing a significant difference in readmission, quality of life or patient satisfaction.</p>

<p>The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT),9 and smaller RCTs using improved management to judge the effect on patient outcomes, used multidisciplinary team input (in particular from specialist nurses and dietitians) as part of an integrated package to improve metabolic intermediate outcomes. A Cochrane review10 of diabetes specialist nurse input identified six heterogeneous studies unsuitable for meta-analysis, and found little evidence of longer-term impact on intermediate outcomes. An RCT11 of the impact of structured team care as compared to usual care showed improved satisfaction and blood glucose control at six months. An RCT12 of the use of diabetes specialist nurses to adjust insulin doses over the telephone showed improved blood glucose control.</p>

<p>As having Type 1 diabetes can have a major impact on lifestyle and self-esteem, it would appear that support groups could have a role in providing for some needs outside the professional environment and even separately from immediate carers. The range of such potential input is large and might stretch from simply fulfilling a need for belonging, through to helping with diabetes-related financial problems (such as insurance), and even providing a further source of diabetes-related information. Coping with diabetes, or any other condition, is influenced not only by psychological characteristics of the individual but also by social relationships (eg support and communication byhealthcare team, family and friends). Informal interpersonal variables, such as social resources and support, have been found to be associated with better diabetes self-management,56 7 family environment,58 60 and marital interaction.61 A medical condition is only one aspect that affects the make-up of an individual s personal identity, and for some may be perceived as a minor factor compared to their environmental and social circumstances. A support group is defined in this guideline as a group of people with Type 1 diabetes that comes together to provide support to themselves and others in their locality. Members are usually unpaid and many will be supported under the auspices of national (or local) voluntary organisations. Support groups have become commonplace throughout health and social care. Patients and carers may choose to contact or be involved with support groups to gain information and support to benefit their own needs, or with a wider altruistic aim of helping other people within the local community. It was not possible to find specific research identifying patient and carer preferences for support groups, or indeed to identify specific groups or types of people who may benefit more than others. Some people attend meetings of groups regularly whilst other individuals are reassured by being aware of a group s existence and the opportunity to contact the group at a later date if problems arise and/or support is required. Preferences are dependent on what stage people are at in their lives and what information is taken (or needs to be taken) on board.</p>
<ul>

<p>Support groups At the time of diagnosis and periodically thereafter, adults with Type 1 diabetes should be offered up-to-date information on the existence of and means of contacting diabetes support groups (local and national) and the benefits of membership. ’</p>

<p>The Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes and Needs (DAWN) questionnaire study 62 highlighted that emotional support, along with family support, was a key factor in how well people with diabetes manage their condition, with support networks being considered at least as important as the medication they take in helping them manage their diabetes. Interim results also indicate that people who do not have access to a community of support, especially the young or elderly living alone, may be less likely to be concordant with their medication regimes, putting them at risk of inadequate control of their diabetes</p>

<p>Having diabetes involves acquiring a great range of new skills and knowledge, including insulin therapy, dietary changes, self-monitoring, hypoglycaemia, jobs, travel, physical exercise, coping w ith concurrent illness, foot care, arterial risk control and avoiding complications. The history of education and information giving in diabetes care goes back to the earliest dietary interventions several centuries ago, and the use of education professionals to impart skills associated with insulin therapy dates from the time of discovery and isolation of insulin. Ac co r dingly patient education is a true corner stone that enables self-management of diabetes, and most diabetes management is self-management. Review of other parts of this NICE guideline will reveal that education and information giving are parts of nearly all of them, from enabling patient choice in determining features of self-management, to acquisition of skills needed to perform tasks and make judgements, to self-care where high risk complications have developed, and to skills in handling healthcare professionals to ensure that issues of importance to the person with Type 1 diabetes are addressed.</p>
<p>The group noted that patient education was a necessary and logical part of most aspects of diabetes self-care, and that self-care was a social, health and economic necessity in the manage- ment of the condition. Specific recommendations related to aspects of care such as self- monitoring, insulin therapy, foot care and nutrition were thought best presented in the individual sections of this guideline. The group noted inap propriateness of the classical clinical trial model when just one feature of an integrated pac kage was varied, and one of many possible outputs monitored as primary outcome. There is also the difficulty of, and lack of funding for, the larger, longer-term trials used for pharmaceutical interventions. Equally, the central role of education in achieving success in blood glucose control and health outcomes (DCCT and other key studies) c ould not be ignored. Such information suggested that educational interventions were likely to be c ost-effective, but it was impossible to make compar ative judgements of different education models, a conclusion seemingly also reached by the NICE Appraisal Committee on the basis of a re port from the University of Southamptons health technology assessment unit. Is sues of information overload at the stressful time of diagnosis, the size of the longer-term educational needs of individuals, the diversity of individual needs, and the retention of the information needed to make informed choices, and the groups experience of these in practice, served to guide recommendations broadly in line with those of Diabetes UK and the International Diabetes Federation (Europe).</p>
<p>Structured diabetes education A programme of structured diabetes education covering all major aspects of diabetes self-care and the reasons for it should be made available to all adults with Type 1 diabetes in the months after diagnosis, and periodically thereafter according to agreed need following yearly assessment. ’</p>

<p>Within an overall review of patient education models for diabetes (not type-specific) one health technology assessment80 reviewing four controlled trials of a range of education programmes including items of self-management, self-monitoring, diet and the effects of insulin and exercise, taught by a variety of staff or self-taught, and as an initial intense course or as ongoing programmes, reported a variety of positive outcomes compared to normal care. This review found that one study had demonstrated improvements over 10 years in diabetic control, in ter ms of reduced HbA 1c levels. In another study, an intensive five-day training course was found to be effective in reducing HbA 1c levels. In one study there was no difference in blood gl ucose control with education compared to usual care, while there were no between-group co mparisons made in another other study. Education was also shown to improve blood pressure. There is limited evidence to suggest a reduced rate of ketoacidosis and reduced hospitalisation. However, there was no evidence to indicate that education can reduce body mass index. There is some data to suggest increased incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes. Long-term outcomes of retinopathy or neuro pathy were not found to be significantly affected by education, but there is some limited evidence to suggest nephropathy incidence is improved, although rates were low. Unsurprisingly, diabetes knowledge was significantly improved with education, although this was not true of quality of life. Overall the included trials were of moderate methodological rigour. Three of the trials included were investigating education in the context of intensification of treatment compared to normal care, and it is difficult to be sure that the benefits reported are directl y attributable to the education aspect of the intervention.</p>

<p>A ssessing the cost-effectiveness of patient education is complicated by the fact that patient education is rarely assessed in isolation. Recent NICE guidance 338 into patient education models considered the health economic evidence for interventions in terms of self-care, quality of life and the long-term complications of diabetes. Interventions improving knowledge of diabetes were excluded from consideration, as improved knowledge of diabetes does not necessarily affect subsequent outcomes. The NICE appraisal found only two published health economic papers suitable for assessing patient education. 339,340 Of these, only one 339 included Type 1 diabetes patients, and this established cost-effectiveness ratios for altering food habits.</p>

<p>In sulin therapy has to be adjusted with lifesty le, insulin dose requirements vary from individual to individual, and the effects of insulin injections are notoriously erratic. It might seem obvious that being able to keep an hour-to-hour or day-to-day check on actual blood glucose levels w ould be to the advantage of any person using insulin therapy. Potential should exist here to assist with diabetes self-education, dose optimisat ion, reassurance over hypoglycaemia and helping professionals give optimum advice on insulin regimens.</p>
<p>Self-monitoring does not, in itself, appear to improve blood glucose control. However, the gr oup noted that it was an essential component of the markedly improved blood glucose control with improved outcomes demonstrated in the landmark DCCT study, and indeed in the other smaller studies of blood glucose control and complications. Indeed it was difficult for members of the group to conceive how modern flexible insulin dosage regimens could be adopted without it. However, the technique is not easy, painless or convenient, and as a result no one system is found appropriate for use by all individuals. Improved technical facility could be identified from clinical experience. Nevertheless appropriate training and quality of skills re vi ew is agreed as necessary and normal practice. Different individuals are noted to use this te c hnology with different frequencies and for different needs according to personal preferences. Given the nature of the technology it is rarely abused. A newer approach, using smaller blood samples from non-finger-prick sites, was not judged to have adequate evidence of reliability, particularly in the situation of hypoglycaemia, to allow a general recommendation.</p>

<p>Ty pe 1 diabetes is for most of the time asymptomatic once effective therapy is instituted. However, it is generally understood that there is a re lationship between blood glucose control and the late complications of the condition. Together these observations suggest that some means of monitoring blood glucose control should help healthcare professionals advise people with diabetes to best effect on insulin doses, regimens and associated lifestyle issues.</p>
<p>The group endorsed the utility of having a frame of reference against which people with diabetes and the professionals advising them could assess risk and risk threshold for micro- and macro-vascular disease in terms of blood glucose control. This was a core component of intensification of therapy in studies showing improved long-term outcomes. HbA 1c is the only measure for which quantitative information linking glucose control to complications is av ailable, and then only when standardised to the assay used in the DCCT study. Near patient t esting was felt to be a core component of making optimal and relevant use of HbA 1c re sults. Co ntinuous glucose monitoring systems were considered to not yet have established their usefulness beyond problem-solving in the occasional person with recurrent blood glucose co ntrol problems at the same time of day.</p>
<p>Clinical monitoring of blood glucose levels Clinical monitoring of blood glucose levels by high precision DCCT-aligned methods of haemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c ) should be performed every two to six months depending on:</p>

<h2 id="topic-cg15adults11">Topic CG15AdultS11</h2>
<p>The DCCT, and a number of smaller studies which are potentially underpowered, 113 suggest that more intensive management of people with Type 1 diabetes (by themselves, with advice) re duces the rate of development of microvascular complications over a period of years. The primary metabolic improvement in the DCCT was lowering of blood glucose level, and this was the measure used in that study to drive the intensification of therapy. This suggests that using measures of blood glucose control in the routine management of therapy in people with Type 1 diabetes is well founded. A question then arises as to what level of blood glucose control people with diabetes should ch oose to strive for. A closely related question is what level(s) of glucose control should be used in assessing the performance of diabetes services. Targets have been criticised by some as not giving flexibility for individuals with particular problems (eg hypoglycaemia) to be content with higher HbA 1c levels, which allows some longer-term risk for a gain in current well-being. It is clearly useful to be able to identify those in whom newer and more expensive technologies could be tried in an attempt to reduce microvascular risk, and to distinguish them from those who already achieve safe (or safer) levels on their current therapy. People with diabetes need information on what blood glucose level they need to attain if they wish to minimise vascular risk.</p>
<p>There must be a threshold for glucose control and the development of microvascular co mplications, or non-diabetic people would get complications. Indeed, this threshold must be we ll above the normal range as people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) do not (by definition) get microvascular complications. As people with IGT have HbA 1c levels of up to 7.0%, this by itself sets a lower limit of microvascular risk. The microvascular thresholds of HbA 1c 7.5% set around 10 years ago have stood the test of all data published since. If anything the DCCT, Krolewski and McCance data suggest a figure closer to 8.0%. Re co mmendations from the ADA (7.0%) and American College of Endocrinologists (6.5%) are not specific to type of diabetes; data does suggest macrovascular protection is gained by lowering blood glucose levels into the normal range, and the NICE (inherited) guidelines for Ty pe 2 diabetes go for HbA 1c 6.5% in these higher arterial risk individuals. Some people with Type 1 diabetes are at higher arterial risk, notably those with developing nephropathy. This can be identified by increased albumin excretion rate. The presence of features of the metabolic syndrome will also predict higher arterial risk. It may be appropriate to co nsider tighter targets for glucose control (if feasible) in people in these categories. Ho we ve r, these levels are better considered as assessment levels , to be used in setting realistic targets for the individual. Major diabetes services in Europe currently only get about 20% of people with Type 1 diabetes into the sub-7.5% bracket. UK composite data (UKDIABS) shows some services doing better, but this may only represent non-standardised GHb estimation. That current technologies of diabetes care markedly limited the proportion of people on insulin w ho were able to manage themselves to ideal levels was not seen as a bar to setting such assessment levels. It was noted that arterial risk would be likely to have a different relationship in this regard from microvascular risk, and that for the former there was little direct information available for people with Type 1 diabetes, but that the understandings gained in Ty pe 2 diabetes and people without diabetes gave strong guidance in this respect. It was felt that as the assessment of the evidence available pointed to target definition in the same range as other published guidelines, and in particular the NICE inherited guidelines for Type 2 diabetes, there was practical utility for practice of care in having matching recommendations. Lastly the problem of hypoglycaemia in limiting was what achievable in any individual should be addressed within any recommendations, to assuage inappropriate attempts to achieve tight co ntrol and counter impressions of failure if targets are not attained.</p>
<p>Maintaining a DCCT-harmonised HbA 1c below 7.5% Adults with Type 1 diabetes should be advised that maintaining a DCCT-harmonised HbA 1c below 7.5% is likely to minimise their risk of developing diabetic eye, kidney or nerve damage in the longer term. ’</p>

Fu r thermore subcutaneous depot insulin preparations have, until recently, not come close to providing the physiological plasma insulin profiles occurring at mealtimes or in the inter- prandial basal state. A number of preparations of mealtime and extended-acting insulins are av ailable, and combining these to suit individual needs, while taking account of preferences for n umbers of injections, gives a variety of possib le insulin regimens of differing characteristics. W hile insulin deficiency is the hallmark of Type 1 diabetes, a few people retain some insulin secretion for a short time (and might therefo re benefit from insulin secretagogues). Some gl ucose-lowering drugs work on gut absorption of nutrients or on the insulin effector tissues, and might therefore be expected to be of benefit in some individuals even when completely insulin deficient and managed on insulin replacement therapy.</p>
<p>It was noted that Type 1 diabetes is a hormone deficiency disease. The problems faced by people w ith the condition (injections, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, consequences of capricious co ntrol, late complications) were noted to be solely a function of the poor state of insulin re placement therapy. The group noted that the use of insulin injections in people with Type 1 diabetes is not RCT- based and never could be. It was also noted that, prior to the introduction of short- and long- acting insulin analogues, the use of insulin regimens based on a combination in various forms of unmodified (soluble) human insulin befo re meals and human isophane (NPH) insulin for basal supply had become widespread, and that, the analogues aside, there was no evidence to ch allenge that conventional practice. Long-acting analogues, or rather insulin glargine, are co ve re d by NICE appraisal guidance, and this recommends their availability for use in people w ith Type 1 diabetes. Rapid-acting insulin analogues are supported by an evidence base for less hy poglycaemia at night and at some other times, reduced hyperglycaemic excursions after meals and small improvements in HbA 1c , suggesting that these too should have an increasing r ole in people with Type 1 diabetes. The group was aware that the evidence for combining the advantages of rapid- and long-acting insulin analogues was evolving as the knowledge base to use these technologies improves. This co mbination would be particularly suitable to matching with active mealtime insulin dose adjustment (AMIDA, see dietary recommendations in 6.3). Some recent NICE technology appraisals provided a health economic basis for supporting this regimen, should appropriate improvements in HbA 1c be demonstrated. Accordingly the recommendations were drafted to allow choice of human or combined analogue regimens including from the time of diagnosis. The group noted the potential usefulness of the new insulins in some special situations, including religious feasts and fasts, and shift work. A need to address insulin starters and people who wished for smaller numbers of injections was identified. A need to caution against using newer, more expensive insulins in people with control problems without proper assessment of underlying causes was felt appropriate. The NICE appraisal of insulin pumps (effectively an insulin regimen rather than a device) was noted, and no elaboration felt to be needed on that. The group found the evidence for the general recommendation of any glucose-lowering drug in combination with insulin to be unconvincing. While there may be a small gain in overall gl ucose control evidenced inconsistently in the acarbose studies, the size of this gain, the prevalence of intolerance, and the suggestion of increased hypoglycaemia, together were taken as indicating that no recommendation for the general use of this drug in this context could be made. The use of metformin and insulin sensitisers in people with Type 1 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome has not been adequately investigated. The group was aware of the concern that arterial complications in people with Type 1 diabetes we re associated with features of the metabolic syndrome as seen in Type 2 diabetes, and that there was evidence of benefit in people with Type 2 diabetes for some drugs, notably metformin (UKPDS study) and PPAR- * agonists (see NICE guidance). While not endorsing the general use of such drugs in people with Type 1 diabetes and features of the metabolic syndrome (see section 8.2, Arterial disease management), the group noted that further investigation might support the high a priori likelihood of benefit in this high-risk situation.</p>

<p>F our randomised controlled trials, two large parallel groups, 1578 and two small crossover designs 15960 we re identified that examined the use of acarbose in conjunction with insulin therapy compared to insulin and placebo in each case, in people with Type 1 diabetes. A m ulticentred study 157 w ith variable doses titrated up to 300 mg three times a day for 24 weeks, found a significant reduction in HbA 1c levels with acarbose compared to placebo, and decreases in fasting and post-prandial glucose levels to two hours. There were no differences between gr oups for daily insulin dose or hypoglycaemic ev ents, although adverse events of abdominal pain, diarrhoea and flatulence were more common with acarbose. This led to more frequent tr eatment discontinuation in the acarbose group than the placebo group. A similar Italian tr ial 158 w ith up to 100 mg acarbose three times daily for 24 weeks found no difference in HbA 1c levels, daily insulin dose, fasting glycaemia and total cholesterol. However, a significant decrease was found in two-hour post-prandial plasma glucose level, and HDL cholesterol levels were lower in people on acarbose than placebo. Again minor adverse events were more common in the acarbose group, but hypoglycaemic episodes were similar in both groups. Although care was taken not to alter baseline insulin doses, this could be adjusted if glucose levels exceeded 11.1 mmol/l or reduced with hypoglycaemic episodes</p>

<p>The health economic searches produced no studies giving guidance on appropriate insulin re g imens for those newly-diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes or for the management and prevention of hypoglycaemia, with the exception of the NICE appraisal of insulin glargine. The health economic searches found no published papers dealing with insulin glargine or NPH insulin. A recent NICE technology appraisal 132 re co mmended insulin glargine as a long-acting preparation for people with Type 1 diabet es alongside insulin NPH. The crucial issue for the c ost-effectiveness of insulin glargine is the amount of utility associated with reducing the fear of hypoglycaemia. Tw o cost-benefit studies were identified that considered the role of insulin lispro. 342,380 Ne ither paper was based in the UK (Canada, Australia), and both suggest that the willingness to pay for insulin lispro will outweigh its additional cost. The cost-effectiveness of lispro is unclear and is likely to be most favourable amongst those who require increased flexibility in setting mealtimes, or those for whom mealtimes are often unpredictable. The issue of the cost-effectiveness of intensive insulin therapy is complicated by a shortage of unconfounded data. The DCCT showed that a series of interventions including intensive insulin therapy reduces the rate of diabetic complications and increases life expectancy amongst an unrepresentative sample of adults and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes. Because of the co mplexity of this intervention, health economic analysis of the DCCT data has typically assumed that these reductions are primarily due to intensive insulin regimens. The health economic searches found three models designed to find the cost-effectiveness of intensive treatment, 3434,381 of which two attempted to form QALYs. The health utility values in each of the studies are poor: in one study 343 non-preference-based values are used; in another 381 only a very small sample was used to find health utilities. Both studies considered only a small number of health states and both suggest that intensive therapy is cost-effective. Tw o models analysed intensive treatment in cost-per-life-year terms, and differed in their re sults. One study 343 produced a cost-per-life-year figure of US$28,661 at 1994 prices, whilst another 344 found a figure several times larger. Neither study used UK costs. Note that as several diabetic complications will affect quality of life but will not significantly shorten life expectancy, the cost-per-QALY figure may be lower than the corresponding cost-per-life-year figure. Two c ost analyses also suggest that the DCCT cost estimates may be overestimates. 3456 Few inferences can be drawn because these studies are limited but it appears likely that intensive tr eatment, including intensive insulin regimens, will be cost-effective.</p>

<p>As a large protein, insulin cannot be taken orally (it is digested) and is only absorbed across mu c ous membranes (of the nose or inside cheeks for example) very poorly. As a result, it generally has to be injected or infused into the subcutaneous fat. Self-use of injection devices is not something most people adopt happily by choice, and since the late 1970s various solutions to making this easier and more satisfactory have been developed.</p>
<p>In sulin injection pens were noted to be the overwhelming norm in the UK for insulin delivery for reasons of convenience, ease of teaching and portability. Some devices with particular design characteristics can be used by people with disabilities, where otherwise a third party w ould have to give injections. The desirability and often cost-effectiveness of this was noted. In jection into deep subcutaneous fat, and on the basis of many studies into the tissues of the abdominal wall for mealtime unmodified human insulin, are generally advised and logically based. However the needs and beliefs of individuals in giving their own insulin were felt to be of importance. Simple logic also leads to the conclusion that rotation of injection sites should be within one region rather than between regions. Group members (both clinicians and people w ith diabetes) expressed a widespread experience of repeated self-injection with the same needle without problems arising. The group considered the utility of recommending advice on cleanliness for those who choose to re-use needles, but noted the regulatory position from the Me dicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA, formerly the Medical Devices Ag ency) in the bulletin DB2000(04). Consequently, the guideline cannot make such a re co mmendation. Other common sense issues included provision for sharps disposal, and ch eck on the condition of injection sites annually or if blood glucose control problems worsen.</p>
<p>access to insulin injection delivery device Adults with Type 1 diabetes who inject insulin should have access to the insulin injection delivery device they find allows them optimal well-being, often using one or more types of insulin injection pen. ’</p>

<p>NICE guidance 165 co ncluded that, compared to optimised MDI therapy, CSII results in a modest but worthwhile improvement in GHb and quality of life (by allowing greater flexibility of lifestyle), and reduction of other problems such as hypoglycaemia and rising blood glucose levels at the end of the night. In routine practi c e, patients who go on to pumps are carefully selected, and to a large degree self-select ed. Overall, insulin pumps appear to be a useful advance for patients having particular problems, rather than a dramatic breakthrough in therapy, and would probably be used only in a small percentage of patients</p>

<p>One randomised crossover trial 167 co mpared two types of insulin regimen injected in the abdomen with the same regimen injected in the thigh. Regular insulin injections in the abdomen resulted in significantly lower post-prandial plasma glucose values, peak plasma gl ucose and increment in plasma glucose compared to time periods following injection in the thigh. Significantly higher serum free insulin values were also seen following abdominal injection of regular insulin, compared with injections administered at the thigh. No differences we re re co rd ed between injections at either site following injections containing both isophane (NPH) and unmodified (soluble) insulin</p>

<h2 id="topic-cg15adults14">Topic CG15AdultS14</h2>
<p>Hy poglycaemia is, for most people using insulin therapy, an inevitable consequence of the erratic absorption of insulin from subcutaneous tissue after depot injection or infusion, c oupled with absence of feedback to insulin need when changes in planned activity or eating occur once the injection has been given. Hypoglycaemia is usually unpleasant, often becomes a source of fear, and can be an embarrassment as well as a safety risk. Accordingly, while careful ch oice of insulin regimen (section 7.3) informed by self-monitoring (section 6.2) is important in ameliorating this problem, other preventative measures are of importance. A higher level of optimised management is needed when hypoglycaemia and its related problems do occur.</p>
<p>The group noted this was an area of considerable importance to people with Type 1 diabetes, but that prevention of hypoglycaemia was considered appropriately under insulin therapy re co mmendations, and secondarily under education and lifestyle issues. The group noted issues re lated to absorption and ingestion of free carbohydrate in people with decreased conscious level. They were concerned that recurrent hypoglycaemia was properly considered in a medical co ntext, and not simply attributed to lifestyle problems secondary to insulin therapy. Hy poglycaemia unawareness was also noted to be an important issue, and be partially reversible and capable of useful management, as now is nocturnal hypoglycaemia (it was noted that the re co mmendations on insulin therapy and clinical monitoring addressed other aspects of such management). No useful hard evidence was available for cognitive decline occurring in people w ith Type 1 diabetes, but the possibility of recurrent severe hypoglycaemia being a contributory factor was felt worth mentioning. The group noted that the ease and safety of administration of glucagon compared to IV glucose (risk of extravasation) meant that in most situations it was the treatment of choice. While it was re co g nised that there were groups of people to whom the identified studies do not apply (starvation, alcohol toxic), and that these people would not be expected to respond well to gl ucagon, it was agreed that the best means of detecting this was by absence of a response to gl ucagon at 10 minutes. Safe follow-up management after either therapy should include oral carbohydrate and awareness of risk of relapse. Users of glucagon injections need appropriate education and training.</p>
<p>management of hypoglycaemic symptoms Adults with Type 1 diabetes should be informed that any available glucose/sucrose containing fluid is suitable for the management of hypoglycaemic symptoms or signs in people who are able to swallow. Glucose containing tablets or gels are also suitable for those able to dissolve or disperse these in the mouth and swallow the products. ’</p>

<p>Canadian clinical practice guidelines 98 re ported four studies supporting the use of 15 g glucose (monosaccharide) (orally) for the treatment of moderate hypoglycaemia. Two studies within the guidelines explored a 20 g oral glucose dose for recovery of blood glucose levels. Recovery was slower following treatment with milk and orange juice. The use of glucose gel also delivered slower recovery in the latter study and required swallowing to have a significant effect. A further study showed no support for buccal administration of glucose</p>

<p>C ultural and genetic differences between ethnic groups are known to affect health and response to healthcare for many diseases. In regard of Type 1 diabetes this is particularly true of eating habits, while arterial risk is known to differ for the general population and people with Type 2 diabetes. Other care issues seem likely.</p>
<p>The group were aware of a systematic review designed to detect issues of relevance (rather than trials of interventions) and identified papers concerning differences in incidence, attitudes to complications, degree of response to education programmes, blood glucose control, religious fasting and feasting, and hospitalisation. The group noted that cultural and genetic issues affected diabetes healthcare delivery in the areas of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>patient education and self-care</p></li>
<li><p>nutritional advice</p></li>
<li><p>insulin therapy (including religious feasts and fasts)</p></li>
<li><p>arterial risk</p></li>
<li><p>blood pressure management</p></li>
<li><p>hospitalisation. Insome areas there was overlap with social/deprivation issues. The groups recommendations address cultural/religious issues in the appropriate sections of this guideline, emphasising the primacy of the individual in this regard.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Manage as an individual Each adult with Type 1 diabetes should be managed as an individual, rather than as a member of any cultural, economic or health-affected group. Attention should be paid to the recommendations given elsewhere in this guideline with respect to the cultural preferences of individual adults with Type 1 diabetes ’</p>
