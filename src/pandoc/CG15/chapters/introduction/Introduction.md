# Type 1 Diabetes

Diabetes is a group of disorders with a number of features in common, of which raised blood sugar is the most evident. This guideline is concerned only with type 1 diabetes, a condition that aetiologically is a pure hormone-deficiency disease. However, because hormone replacement with insulin therapy is sub-optimal, acute and long-term complications are endemic despite the implementation of lifestyle and other disease management measures.
