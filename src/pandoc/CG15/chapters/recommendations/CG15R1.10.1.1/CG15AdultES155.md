### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES155
Two controlled but not randomised studies reported within the guideline 174 demonstrated the positive relationship between hypertension and risk of arterial death, with a progressive increase in risk with rising systolic pressure. Each 10 mmHg reduction in systolic pressure is associated with a 15% (95% CI: 1218) reduction in risk of arterial death over 10 years
