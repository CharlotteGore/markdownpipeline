### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES157
Ev idence for the other risk factors is sparse. In the SIGN guidelines, 174 no studies were identified for linking obesity as an indepen dent risk factor in established diabetes. One observational study reported microalbuminuria as an independent marker associated with doubling in arterial risk, however, there is ins ufficient evidence to determine whether reducing albumin excretion rate specifically reduces arterial morbidity or mortality
