### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES158
A meta-analysis 175 aimed at defining risk factors for arterial disease from studies in people with diabetes, showed that, adjusted for age, both total mortality and death from all vascular causes increased significantly with total cholesterol level and systolic blood pressure, and decreased w ith percentage of women. Duration of diabetes and mean HbA 1c we re not considered to be associated with mortality. However, this meta-analysis did not contain a critical appraisal of included studies or details of approaches used to ensure study quality before inclusions and should therefore not be used as the basis for clinical recommendations
