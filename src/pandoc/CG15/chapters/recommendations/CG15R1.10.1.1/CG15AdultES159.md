### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES159
One systematic review 176 e xamined 67 studies, addressing both screening for primary detection of arterial risk factors and treatment of lipid abnormalities in asymptomatic people both with and without diabetes. Reliability and effectiveness of each screening strategy for identifying lipid disorders was investigated, and showed that total cholesterol measurements generally have good reliability, with an analytic variability of less than or equal to 3% and a mean total biologic variability of the order of 6%. A total cholesterol level within 10% of the true value can be determined with two separate measurements, which do not differ significantly between fasting or non-fasting venous blood
