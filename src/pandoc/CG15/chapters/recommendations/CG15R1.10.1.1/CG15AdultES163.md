### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES163
Other studies included in this review 176 assessing characteristics of the screening tests showed that non-fasting total cholesterol alone is the easiest to perform for the patient and provider. T otal:HDL cholesterol ratio is easy for patients to obtain and for providers to interpret and performs equally accurately as the LDL:HDL cholesterol ratio strategy. However, one study in the review demonstrated that risk-based algorithms which directly incorporate age, other risk factors and measures of total and HDL cholesterol are the most accurate approach to screening. These processes are difficult to access and so supplemental tables, such as the Sheffield table, can improve the feasibility of a risk-based strategy
