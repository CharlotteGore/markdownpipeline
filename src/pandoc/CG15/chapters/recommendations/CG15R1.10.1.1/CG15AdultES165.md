### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES165
One study 177 co mparing the Sheffield tables to the computer-calculated Framingham equation re v ealed a low sensitivity and specificity for the Sheffield tables (35% (95% CI 28 to 42) and 98% (95% CI 97 to 99) respectively). The old tab les only included patients with systolic blood pressure <160 mmHg, and cholesterol greater than 5.5 mmol/l. Adopting these exclusion criteria led to a substantial reduction in the number of patients eligible for screening without improving detection of risk assessment
