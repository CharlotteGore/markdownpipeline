### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES168
The sensitivity and specificity of various risk pr ediction tables and charts was also investigated in one comparative study. 180 Co mpared to the Framingham equation the Sheffield tables had a low sensitivity (40% eligible for cholesterol lowering treatment would be identified), but with high specificity and thus low false positive rates. The New Zealand tables had similar sensitivities and specificities to the Sheffield tables, but a 10% level of risk prediction of five- y ear arterial disease risk threshold specificity is significantly lower than the Sheffield tables. The Eu ro pean tables have better sensitivity than Sheffield and New Zealand tables but specificity is significantly worse than other risk assessment levels leading to an equally low sensitivity. The joint British Societies table has significantly better specificities at greater than or equal to 15% and greater than or equal to 30% 10-year CHD risk than the modified Sheffield tables. Sensitivity is generally low, but high at the 15% 10-year CHD/10% five-year CVD risk level. Canadian tables are not reliable at greater than or equal to 30% risk but are comparable with the modified Sheffield tables at 154% risk threshold. The Framingham equation had the best performance with sensitivity and specificity comparable to that of the modified Sheffield and joint British Society methods, respectively
