### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES170
SIGN guidelines on lipids 181 and the prevention of ischaemic heart disease detail studies targeted at people with Type 2 diabetes. However, secondary prevention trials of lipids reported 77 Feature Women Men Blood pressure average (mmHg) >135/80 >135/80 Waist circumference (m) (use 0.10m lower >0.90 >1.00 figures for people of South Asian extraction) Serum HDL cholesterol (mmol/l) <1.2 <1.0 Serum triglycerides (mmol/l) >1.8 >1.8 Raised albumin exrection rate is not included because in Type 1 diabetes it is a marker of developing nephropathy and nephropathy alone is associated with extreme risk of ischaemic heart disease. Glucose intolerance cannot be assessed in adults with Type 1 diabetes, but higher insulin doses in adults >20 years (>1.0 U/kg/day) suggest insulin insensitivity. Table 4 Features of the metabolic syndrome suggesting high arterial risk in people with Type 1 diabetes in the guideline have shown significant reduction in arterial disease in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. These guidelines recommend the loss of weight, reduction of intake of saturated fat, increased consumption of fruit and vegetables, regular exercise and the introduction of lipid- lowering drug treatment for primary prevention of arterial problems in high-risk people with diabetes. The guidelines also report a study raising concern about underestimating diabetic ischaemic heart disease risk, particularly in people with Type 1 diabetes
