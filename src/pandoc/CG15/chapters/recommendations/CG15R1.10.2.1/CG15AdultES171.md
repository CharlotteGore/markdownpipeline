### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES171
The SIGN guidelines 174 re port on a number of therapeutic studies. The CARE study demonstrated a significant reduction in coronary events with pravastatin vs placebo, although the magnitude of effect was lower than in the 4S study. The LIPID study also showed a trend to re duction in recurrent coronary events but numbers of people with diabetes in this study were to o low to demonstrate statistical significance. The VA-HIT study showed significant secondary prevention of coronary events in men with diabetes aged less than 74 years, taking a fibrate (gemfibrozil) for a mean follow-up of 5.1 years
