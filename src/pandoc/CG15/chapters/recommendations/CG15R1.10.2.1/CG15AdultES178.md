### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES178
The North of England guidelines 188 on aspirin for the secondary prophylaxis of vascular disease in primary care reported a pooled risk ratio by combining he meta-analysis of the Antiplatelet Co llaborative Group with trials published after 1990 to establish the impact of antiplatelet therapy on subsequent myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and vascular death. This provided strong evidence for a general protective effect of aspirin as antiplatelet therapy in patients at r aised vascular risk. Few studies were found containing comparisons of aspirin and alternative antiplatelet agents to enable comparison of their relative effectiveness
