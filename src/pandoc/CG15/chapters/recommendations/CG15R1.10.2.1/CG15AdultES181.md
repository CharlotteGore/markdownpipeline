The ADA guidelines 76 also reported on the HOT study, which showed a reduction in arterial ev ents following aspirin therapy compared to placebo of 15% and a 36% reduction in my ocardial infarction. This study also showed that fatal bleeding including intracerebral bleeding were equal in aspirin and control groups, whereas non-fatal minor bleeding episodes we re more frequent in patients receiving aspirin. The US Physicians Health study reported in the same guideline compared aspirin (325 mg/day) with placebo in male physicians (without diabetes), resulting in a 44% risk reduction in MI among the treated group. In a subgroup of people with diabetes there was a reduction in MI from 10% to 4% yielding a relative risk of 0.39 for men with diabetes randomised to aspirin therapy
