### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES186
One meta-analysis 190 of six randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials showed a significant pooled reduction in mortality following treatment with platelet glycoprotein inhibitors. The most marked benefit was seen in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. A significant reduction in composite death or MI at 30 days was also seen following treatment in people with diabetes. However, potential methodological limitations of the trials included would not permit this analysis to be used as a evidence base to inform re co mmendations in this area
