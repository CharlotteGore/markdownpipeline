### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES191
Three large trials (AIRE, SAVE and TRACE studies) 174 also reviewed within the SIGN guideline have shown consistent reductions in mortality when ACE inhibitor therapy is given to people after acute MI with clinical evidence of heart failure or a reduced ejection fraction. A fourth study (SOLVD) demonstrated an absolute risk reduction for mortality of 4.5% in patients with diabetes and chronic heart failure given an ACE inhibitor compared to placebo over a mean follow-up of 4.5 years
