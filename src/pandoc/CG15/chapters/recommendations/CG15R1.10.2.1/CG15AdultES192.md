### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES192
A predefined subgroup analysis of 3,577 people over 55 with diabetes (the majority of whom had Type 2 diabetes) in the large multinational HOPE randomised controlled trial 191 showed the effect of ramipril on arterial outcomes in people with diabetes. The rate of combined primary outcome of MI, stroke or arterial death was significantly lower in the ramipril groups than in those receiving placebo. Total mortality was reduced by 24%. Adjustment for changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressures did not change the magnitude of the effect
