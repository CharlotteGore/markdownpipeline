### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES195
W hilst economic analyses have been conducted on trials of lipid-lowering agents, no evaluation has specifically considered Type 1 diabetes. Three papers were identified within the health economic literature dealing with mixed diabetic populations. 35052 An economic analysis 350 of simvastatin using the 4S trial data suggests that it would provide cost-effective mortality re duction in the UK amongst a similar population. A second cost-effectiveness paper 351 also suggests that the simvastatin may be cost-effective in the UK for those aged 40 to 70 years with elevated cholesterol even if they have not been diagnosed with arterial disease. A third paper based outside the UK suggests that the benefits of simvastatin to diabetics with elevated lipid levels and arterial disease outweigh the benefit to those with elevated lipid levels and no prior arterial disease. 352
