### Discussion
The data on arterial risk management in people with Type 1 diabetes are few, though it is noted that studies in people with and without Type 2 diabetes point to clinically effective interventions for those groups. In the absence of quantitative risk assessment and noting the economic evidence placed before the group it seemed clear that interventions in people with Ty pe 1 diabetes must be recommended considering their semi-quantitative arterial disease risk: high, moderate or no risk. Given the high arterial risk of many people with Type 1 diabetes, smoking was considered to be particularly disadvantageous.
