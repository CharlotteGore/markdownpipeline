## Advice on smoking cessation
Adults with Type 1 diabetes who smoke should be given advice on smoking cessation and use of smoking cessation services, including NICE guidance-recommended therapies. The messages should be reinforced in continuing smokers yearly if pre-contemplative of stopping, and at all clinical contacts if there is a prospect of their stopping.
