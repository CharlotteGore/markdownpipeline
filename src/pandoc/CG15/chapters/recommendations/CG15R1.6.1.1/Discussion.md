The group endorsed the commentary discussed above, and concluded that simple
recommendations were all that were required. Although in this condition diagnosis of diabetes is rarely in doubt, errors do arise in attribution of diabetes type on occasions, and this is known to result in negative consequences including failure to anticipate ketoacidosis or unnecessary insulin therapy. Accordingly the group felt that cautionary recommendations were in order. The group noted that formal evidence of the utility of tests to distinguish type of diabetes by auto-immune markers or measures of islet B-cell function was not positive, and that these tests were not routinely performed. The group were keen to reiterate the importance of laboratory glucose estimation in line with WHO recommendations to avoid the very rare misdiagnoses with lifelong consequences. The25 role of symptoms and of HbA1c estimation were seen as useful but only supportive, as both lack absolute specificity.
