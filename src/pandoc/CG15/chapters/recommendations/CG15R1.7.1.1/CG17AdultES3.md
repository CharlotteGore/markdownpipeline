### Evidence Statement CG17AdultES3
The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT),9 and smaller RCTs using improved management to judge the effect on patient outcomes, used multidisciplinary team input (in particular from specialist nurses and dietitians) as part of an integrated package to improve metabolic intermediate outcomes. A Cochrane review10 of diabetes specialist nurse input identified six heterogeneous studies unsuitable for meta-analysis, and found little evidence of longer-term impact on intermediate outcomes. An RCT11 of the impact of structured team care as compared to usual care showed improved satisfaction and blood glucose control at six months. An RCT12 of the use of diabetes specialist nurses to adjust insulin doses over the telephone showed improved blood glucose control.
