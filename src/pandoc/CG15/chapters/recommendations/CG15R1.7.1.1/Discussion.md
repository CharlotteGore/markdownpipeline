### Discussion
The group endorsed the approaches suggested by the evidence, but noted that attempts to implement some of the recommendations in the past had been inhibited by funding difficulties.This however was not felt to be a barrier to reiterating the health gains to be obtained. It was noted that recent publications (beyond the cut-off date of the searches) supported some of the recommendations further, including those relating to specialist nurses. The UKs national service framework for diabetes was noted to have endorsed diabetes registers. The group recognised the lack of any kind of formal evidence relating to walk-in, telephone-request and out-of-hours services.
