## Topic CG15AdultS2
The management of diabetes is multidimensional, and each dimension is multifaceted. Notable dimensions include diagnosis and associated management, preventative long-term care, hospital and emergency management, and detection and management of late-developing complications. With each of these dimensions a number of care areas are found (for example in long-term prevention, glucose control, blood pressure control, risk factor surveillance, blood lipid control and smoking), and for each care area a number of deliverables addressed (for example in blood glucose control: knowledge and basis of targets, injection skills, selfmonitoring, dose adjustment, dietary matching, hypoglycaemia management, sick day management) by a number of different members of a multidisciplinary team. This
multidimensional care delivery requirement has spawned diverse attempts aimed at ensuring optimal care is available to all those with diabetes. This section of the guideline seeks to examine what evidence is available to support some of these approaches.
