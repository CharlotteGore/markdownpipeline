### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES19
The Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes and Needs (DAWN) questionnaire study 62 highlighted that emotional support, along with family support, was a key factor in how well people with diabetes manage their condition, with support networks being considered at least as important as the medication they take in helping them manage their diabetes. Interim results also indicate that people who do not have access to a community of support, especially the young or elderly living alone, may be less likely to be concordant with their medication regimes, putting them at risk of inadequate control of their diabetes
