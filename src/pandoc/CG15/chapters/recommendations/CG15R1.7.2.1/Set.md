As having Type 1 diabetes can have a major impact on lifestyle and self-esteem, it would appear
that support groups could have a role in providing for some needs outside the professional
environment and even separately from immediate carers. The range of such potential input is
large and might stretch from simply fulfilling a need for belonging, through to helping with
diabetes-related financial problems (such as insurance), and even providing a further source of
diabetes-related information. Coping with diabetes, or any other condition, is influenced not only by psychological characteristics of the individual but also by social relationships (eg support and communication byhealthcare team, family and friends). Informal interpersonal variables, such as social resources and support, have been found to be associated with better diabetes self-management,56�7 family environment,58�60 and marital interaction.61  A medical condition is only one aspect that affects the make-up of an individual�s personal identity, and for some may be perceived as a minor factor compared to their environmental and social circumstances.  A �support group� is defined in this guideline as a group of people with Type 1 diabetes that comes together to provide support to themselves and others in their locality. Members are usually unpaid and many will be supported under the auspices of national (or local) voluntary organisations. Support groups have become commonplace throughout health and social care. Patients and carers may choose to contact or be involved with support groups to gain information and support to benefit their own needs, or with a wider altruistic aim of helping other people within the local community. It was not possible to find specific research
identifying patient and carer preferences for support groups, or indeed to identify specific groups or types of people who may benefit more than others. Some people attend meetings of groups regularly whilst other individuals are reassured by being aware of a group�s existence and the opportunity to contact the group at a later date if problems arise and/or support is required. Preferences are dependent on what stage people are at in their lives and what information is taken (or needs to be taken) on board.
