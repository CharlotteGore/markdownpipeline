### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES25
One randomised controlled study compared two interactive computer schemes to reinforce an educational video. The first gave additional f eedback and information on the correct answers, the second only the correct answers. 78 Pe ople with diabetes in the interactive group scored significantly better in a follow-up test of diabetes knowledge than those following the standard scheme. There were no significant differences in use r ratings for the two software packages, but the people in the additional feedback group had a better diabetes knowledge at baseline, so the re sults may be biased by this confounding factor
