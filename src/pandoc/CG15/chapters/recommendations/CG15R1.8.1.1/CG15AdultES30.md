### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES30
A nother moderate-sized systematic review of eight trials encompassing over 3,000 patients with either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, 83 found that intensive vs brief education on foot care provided a significant decrease in incidence of foot ulcers, and in one trial amputations, but no difference in the same outcomes over seven years in another study. This is despite three trials reporting successful uptake of messages regarding foot care behaviour. Another trial reported in this re vi ew found that an intensive educational inter ve ntion including both people with diabetes and doctors improved the prevalence of serious foot lesions compared to usual care, although the composite outcome of all foot lesions and amputations was not significantly improved. Au thors of the review noted methodological limitations of the included studies, and outcome re porting times varied between individual trials
