### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES33
There are no systematic reviews and few prospective randomised studies that report on methods to improve concordance in self-management in people with Type 1 diabetes. One small unblinded study, 85 w hich was methodologically limited owing to high drop-out rates and inequalities in patient characteristics at baseline, found that an intervention of a self-taught study programme to improve self-control behaviour was able to demonstrate improved adherence to goals of self-monitoring of blood glucose level over 12 weeks. The intervention included a wide range of educational and behavioural choice items, and the relative effectiveness of any of these is hard to define. The methodological limitations of the study w ould not form a rigorous basis for recommending such an approach
