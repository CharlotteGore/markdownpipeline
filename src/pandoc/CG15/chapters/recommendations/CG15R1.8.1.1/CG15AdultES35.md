### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES35
One small- to medium-sized randomised trial of a specialist education programme delivered to people with Type 1 diabetes by a team of physicians, dietitians and specialist nurses found there to be no statistically significant differences in diabetes knowledge or adherence to dietary advice co mpared to a control group who received conventional diabetes education. Both groups improved in both measures immediately after the completion of the education intervention but then knowledge and adherence fell away with time. This trial was sited in Finland and there may be differences in content of conventional diabetes education compared to that of the UK care setting 87
