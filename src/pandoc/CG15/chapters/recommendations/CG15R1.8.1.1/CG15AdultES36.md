### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES36
There were no significant differences in adherence to glucose self-monitoring or in blood gl ucose levels reported at six months between two interventions with novel glucose monitoring devices and control with a standard device from a medium-sized multicentre randomised Type 1 diabetes in adults: national clinical guideline for diagnosis and management tr ial. 88 The trial included a population of people with Type 1 diabetes who had had the co ndition for an average of 14 years. The study was blinded between the two novel monitoring machines, but the people in the control group would have been aware that they were not re ce iv ing the intervention as they continued to use their usual machine. To evaluate adherence all patients were asked to keep diaries of self-monitoring behaviour and this may have stimulated greater adherence even in the control group than under normal everyday self- monitoring conditions
