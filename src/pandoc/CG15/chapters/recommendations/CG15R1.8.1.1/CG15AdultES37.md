### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES37
A ssessing the cost-effectiveness of patient education is complicated by the fact that patient education is rarely assessed in isolation. Recent NICE guidance 338 into patient education models considered the health economic evidence for interventions in terms of self-care, quality of life and the long-term complications of diabetes. Interventions improving knowledge of diabetes were excluded from consideration, as improved knowledge of diabetes does not necessarily affect subsequent outcomes.  The NICE appraisal found only two published health economic papers suitable for assessing patient education. 339,340 Of these, only one 339 included Type 1 diabetes patients, and this established cost-effectiveness ratios for altering food habits.
