Having diabetes involves acquiring a great range of new skills and knowledge, including insulin therapy, dietary changes, self-monitoring, hypoglycaemia, jobs, travel, physical exercise, coping w ith concurrent illness, foot care, arterial risk control and avoiding complications. The history of education and information giving in diabetes care goes back to the earliest dietary interventions several centuries ago, and the use of education professionals to impart skills associated with insulin therapy dates from the time of discovery and isolation of insulin. Ac co r dingly patient education is a true corner stone that enables self-management of diabetes, and most diabetes management is self-management. Review of other parts of this NICE guideline will reveal that education and information giving are parts of nearly all of them, from enabling patient choice in determining features of self-management, to acquisition of skills needed to perform tasks and make judgements, to self-care where high risk complications have developed, and to skills in handling healthcare professionals to ensure that issues of importance to the person with Type 1 diabetes are addressed.
