### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES39
One study within the systematic review 89 co mparing self-reported readings against a memory meter showed that inaccuracies in readings were common. This was due to rounding of values, omission of outlying values and reporting of re sults when no test had been performed. These findings were confirmed in another reviewed study of 14 people who recorded lower blood gl ucose values in logbook records than meter memories
