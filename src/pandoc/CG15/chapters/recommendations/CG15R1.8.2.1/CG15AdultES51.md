### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES51
The DCCT included self-monitoring of blood glucose as part of intensive treatment. Self-monitoring is only likely to have an effect on blood glucose control when used to inform the management of diabetes. As such, it is not feasible to analyse its cost-effectiveness in isolation from the requirements of subsequent management strategies.  A recent HTA report 89 identifies one paper considering the cost-effectiveness of blood or urine glucose monitoring against conventional dietary control amongst those with Type 1 diabetes. 341 This paper is based on Russian conditions and also includes education in the intervention technologies. The GDG felt that differences in international healthcare systems mean little weight could be placed on its assertions that no significant difference exists between blood and urine glucose monitoring
