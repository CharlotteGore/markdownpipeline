### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES59

In addition there was no relationship with HbA1c level or severe hypoglycaemia. However there was a relationship between liberalised diet and higher cholesterol levels, and an inverse relationship with tendency to monitor blood gl ucose more than three times a day
