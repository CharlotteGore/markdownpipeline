### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES66
A medium-sized randomised controlled trial 105 of intensive advice and lifestyle programme w ith specified diet and exercise prescriptions compared to conventional care found that HbA 1c decreased from baseline measurements significantly over six months in the control group but re mained relatively stable in the intervention group, but no between-group comparison was made. Also, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides were not significantly different between groups at any phase of the study. However exercise sessions were not standardised in the study and a lack of blinding limited the validity of the trial
