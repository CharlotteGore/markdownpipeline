### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES67
A small before and after study 106 found that an intervention of 10 hours of education and physical training three or four times a week produced no metabolic response at three months w ith fasting plasma glucose levels and serum cholesterol not changing significantly. Without blinding or randomisation this evidence is not sufficient to support the use of a mixed education and exercise intervention for people with Type 1 diabetes
