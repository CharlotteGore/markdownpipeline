### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES89
An HTA report 112 produced cost estimates for near patient testing conducted by a laboratory or nurse against conventional testing. However, little data was available on the effects of near patient testing on clinical or quality of life outcomes. For health economics to provide guidance in this area, the long-term effects of different types of clinical monitoring on glycaemic control and subsequent complications must be known. A recent HTA report 89 re co mmended further research into the cost-effectiveness of near patient t esting for diabetes, FBG and fructosamine testing. No other paper in the health economics searches specifically addressed the issue of clinical monitoring
