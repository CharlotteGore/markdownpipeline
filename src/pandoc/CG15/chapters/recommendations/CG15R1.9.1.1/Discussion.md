The group endorsed the utility of having a frame of reference against which people with diabetes and the professionals advising them could assess risk and risk threshold for micro- and macro-vascular disease in terms of blood glucose control. This was a core component of intensification of therapy in studies showing improved long-term outcomes. HbA 1c is the only measure for which quantitative information linking glucose control to complications is av ailable, and then only when standardised to the assay used in the DCCT study. Near patient t esting was felt to be a core component of making optimal and relevant use of HbA 1c re sults. Co ntinuous glucose monitoring systems were considered to not yet have established their usefulness beyond problem-solving in the occasional person with recurrent blood glucose co ntrol problems at the same time of day.
