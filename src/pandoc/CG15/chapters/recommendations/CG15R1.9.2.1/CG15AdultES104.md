### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES104
A further cohort study 124 looked in more detail at GHb, fasting and 2h glucose as diagnostic methods (and thus mainly Type 2 diabetes), using retinopathy and nephropathy as outcome measures. It may be noted that the Wisconsin data suggested that the microvascular/glucose co ntrol relationships were the same in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. The data presentations are strongly reminiscent of previous work, 122 w ith low and unchanging incidence of microvascular disease up to an inflection point, then sharply rising rates. The thresholds for fasting glucose appear to be somewhere above 6.8 mmol/l (consistent with older OGTT data), and HbA 1c somewhere above 7.4% (and below 9.1%)
