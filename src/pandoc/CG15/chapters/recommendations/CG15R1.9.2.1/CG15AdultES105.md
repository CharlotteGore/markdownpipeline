### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES105
Tw o non-randomised controlled studies 116,125 re port the relationship between HbA 1c and self- monitored pre- and post-prandial glucose levels. The reports are consistent and can be related to D CCT-harmonised assays. It must be noted that these studies used pre-determined, self- monitored profiles taken from memory meters, and cannot easily be translated into patient- selected estimations, or only pre-prandial monitoring. They also omit the effects of night-time gl ucose profiles between bedtime and pre-breakfast readings. These data give the most robust ev idence of the relationship between HbA 1c and the toxic glucose concentrations which actually cause the microvascular damage
