### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES92
In 1998, the European Diabetes Policy Group revised its terminology to assessment levels, giving advice on how to use assessment levels to set targets for individuals. These were, for HbA 1c : adequate 6.27.5%, inadequate >7.5%. However the relation of this 7.5% to glucose levels was then revised to equivalent to a self-monitored pre-prandial level of 6.5 mmol/l and post-prandial 9.0 mmol/l. These post-DCCT recommendations are not justified in the text 115
