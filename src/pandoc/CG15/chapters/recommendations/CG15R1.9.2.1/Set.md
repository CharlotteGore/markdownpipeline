The DCCT, and a number of smaller studies which are potentially underpowered, 113 suggest that more intensive management of people with Type 1 diabetes (by themselves, with advice) re duces the rate of development of microvascular complications over a period of years. The primary metabolic improvement in the DCCT was lowering of blood glucose level, and this was the measure used in that study to drive the intensification of therapy. This suggests that using measures of blood glucose control in the routine management of therapy in people with Type 1 diabetes is well founded. A question then arises as to what level of blood glucose control people with diabetes should ch oose to strive for. A closely related question is what level(s) of glucose control should be used in assessing the performance of diabetes services. �T argets� have been criticised by some as not giving flexibility for individuals with particular problems (eg hypoglycaemia) to be content with higher HbA 1c levels, which allows some longer-term risk for a gain in current well-being. It is clearly useful to be able to identify those in whom newer and more expensive technologies could be tried in an attempt to reduce microvascular risk, and to distinguish them from those who already achieve safe (or safer) levels on their current therapy. People with diabetes need information on what blood glucose level they need to attain if they wish to minimise vascular risk.
