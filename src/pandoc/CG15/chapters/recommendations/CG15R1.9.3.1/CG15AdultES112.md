### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES112
Ev idence from a large multicentred study suggests that people commonl y inject insulin closer to mealtime than the recommended 30 minutes. Due to slow absorption and delayed action, the use of unmodified (soluble) human insulin as pre-meal dose results in high and variable post-breakfast blood glucose concentrations, which together with the incidence of later hy poglycaemia suggests that this regimen does not give satisfactory post-prandial blood glucose contr ol in many patients 133
