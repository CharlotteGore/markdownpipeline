### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES127
F our randomised controlled trials, two large parallel groups, 1578 and two small crossover designs 15960 we re identified that examined the use of acarbose in conjunction with insulin therapy compared to insulin and placebo in each case, in people with Type 1 diabetes. A m ulticentred study 157 w ith variable doses titrated up to 300 mg three times a day for 24 weeks, found a significant reduction in HbA 1c levels with acarbose compared to placebo, and decreases in fasting and post-prandial glucose levels to two hours. There were no differences between gr oups for daily insulin dose or hypoglycaemic ev ents, although adverse events of abdominal pain, diarrhoea and flatulence were more common with acarbose. This led to more frequent tr eatment discontinuation in the acarbose group than the placebo group. A similar Italian tr ial 158 w ith up to 100 mg acarbose three times daily for 24 weeks found no difference in HbA 1c levels, daily insulin dose, fasting glycaemia and total cholesterol. However, a significant decrease was found in two-hour post-prandial plasma glucose level, and HDL cholesterol levels were lower in people on acarbose than placebo. Again minor adverse events were more common in the acarbose group, but hypoglycaemic episodes were similar in both groups. Although care was taken not to alter baseline insulin doses, this could be adjusted if glucose levels exceeded 11.1 mmol/l or reduced with hypoglycaemic episodes
