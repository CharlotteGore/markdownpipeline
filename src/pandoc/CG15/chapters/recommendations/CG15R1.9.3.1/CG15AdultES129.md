### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES129
Tw o small randomised controlled trials investigat ed the use of glibenclamide (called glyburide as the trials were conducted in the USA) in the therapy for Type 1 diabetics. A study using 5 mg gl yburide (orally) for 12 weeks compared to placebo after a 12-week open-label insulin stabilisation run-in period 161 found fasting blood glucose declined significantly at 12 weeks from baseline, although no comparison was made between groups. No differences were found in daily insulin dose or glycated haemoglobin le ve ls at any stage of the study. A randomised study without comparison between groups at baseline with 5 mg glyburide daily for 24 weeks co mpared to placebo 162 found no differences in plasma C-peptide levels between groups, nor difference in plasma glucose concentrations at any time point. Although HbA 1c levels were re ported to have changed more from baseline in the glyburide treated group at six weeks, potential methodological limitations of these trials would not permit them to be used as an ev idence base to inform recommendations in this area
