### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES130
Co mparison of 15 mg of glibenclamide daily with placebo in addition to insulin therapy in a small sample of people with Type 1 diabetes in a randomised double-blind crossover study 163 found mean blood glucose level, HbA 1c and blood glucose variability to be significantly lower w ith the intervention among people who retained endogenous insulin production. No such differences were found in a subgroup who were C-peptide negative. Although the study had a medium-term intervention period of three months, it did not provide analysis of the cohort as a whole for glibenclamide vs placebo and thus cannot be used for recommendations given the small sample sizes of the subgroups, and the inherent difficulties of extrapolating such findings to a wider population
