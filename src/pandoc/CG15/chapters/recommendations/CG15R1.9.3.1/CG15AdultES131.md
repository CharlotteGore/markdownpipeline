### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES131
A reduced insulin requirement at 18 months was found in patients given 80 mg gliclazide twice a day compared to placebo in a small sample in a long-term study. 164 Although glycated haemoglobin both fasting and one hour post-breakfast were found to be very similar in both gr oups, the gliclazide group had C-peptide levels significantly higher than people on placebo for the same test times of the day, at six-monthly assessment points to 18 months. This study only applies to people with retained endogenous insulin secretion, and thus not the ov erwhelming majority of people with Type 1 diabetes
