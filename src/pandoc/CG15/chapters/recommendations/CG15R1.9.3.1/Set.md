Ty pe 1 diabetes is an insulin deficiency disease. Physiological insulin delivery is regulated on a minute-to-minute basis, while therapeutic insulin is given a small number of times a day. Fu r thermore subcutaneous depot insulin preparations have, until recently, not come close to providing the physiological plasma insulin profiles occurring at mealtimes or in the inter- prandial basal state. A number of preparations of mealtime and extended-acting insulins are av ailable, and combining these to suit individual needs, while taking account of preferences for n umbers of injections, gives a variety of possib le insulin regimens of differing characteristics. W hile insulin deficiency is the hallmark of Type 1 diabetes, a few people retain some insulin secretion for a short time (and might therefo re benefit from insulin secretagogues). Some gl ucose-lowering drugs work on gut absorption of nutrients or on the insulin effector tissues, and might therefore be expected to be of benefit in some individuals even when completely insulin deficient and managed on insulin replacement therapy.
