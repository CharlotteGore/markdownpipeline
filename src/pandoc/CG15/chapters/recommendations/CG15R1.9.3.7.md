Basal insulin supply (including nocturnal insulin supply) should be provided by the use of isophane (NPH) insulin or long-acting insulin analogues (insulin glargine). Is ophane (NPH) insulin should be given at bedtime. If rapid-acting insulin analogues are given at mealtimes or the midday insulin dose is small or lacking, the need to give isophane (NPH) insulin twice daily (or more often) should be considered.
