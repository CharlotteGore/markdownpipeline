### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES134
NICE guidance 165 co ncluded that, compared to optimised MDI therapy, CSII results in a modest but worthwhile improvement in GHb and quality of life (by allowing greater flexibility of lifestyle), and reduction of other problems such as hypoglycaemia and rising blood glucose levels at the end of the night. In routine practi c e, patients who go on to pumps are carefully selected, and to a large degree self-select ed. Overall, insulin pumps appear to be a useful advance for patients having particular problems, rather than a dramatic breakthrough in therapy, and would probably be used only in a small percentage of patients
