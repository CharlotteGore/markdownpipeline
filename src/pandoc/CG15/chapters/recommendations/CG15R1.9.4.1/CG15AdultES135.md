### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES135
One randomised trial 166 of medium sample size compared a multiple injection regimen from a pen injector with conventional treatment with twice-daily syringe injection. No significant differ- ences were seen in GHb values, blood glucose values or hypoglycaemic episodes. Patient satisfac- tion with pen injectors was high and most patients opted to continue on this delivery system following termination of the trial. However, this study has some methodological limitations
