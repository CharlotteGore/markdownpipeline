### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES136
One randomised crossover trial 167 co mpared two types of insulin regimen injected in the abdomen with the same regimen injected in the thigh. Regular insulin injections in the abdomen resulted in significantly lower post-prandial plasma glucose values, peak plasma gl ucose and increment in plasma glucose compared to time periods following injection in the thigh. Significantly higher serum free insulin values were also seen following abdominal injection of regular insulin, compared with injections administered at the thigh. No differences we re re co rd ed between injections at either site following injections containing both isophane (NPH) and unmodified (soluble) insulin
