### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES140
Canadian clinical practice guidelines 98 re ported four studies supporting the use of 15 g glucose (monosaccharide) (orally) for the treatment of moderate hypoglycaemia. Two studies within the guidelines explored a 20 g oral glucose dose for recovery of blood glucose levels. Recovery was slower following treatment with milk and orange juice. The use of glucose gel also delivered slower recovery in the latter study and required swallowing to have a significant effect. A further study showed no support for buccal administration of glucose
