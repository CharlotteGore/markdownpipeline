### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES144
A randomised controlled study 170 co mpared blood glucose awareness training (BGAT) with no tr aining on the increased hypoglycaemia after initiation of more intensive diabetes management. The counter-regulatory hormone epinephrine (adrenaline) response was not impaired following BGAT despite an increase in frequency of hypoglycaemia induced by intensive diabetes management. No difference was seen in awareness of the symptoms of hy poglycaemia following BGAT, compared with controls, although BGAT does lead to a better detection of low blood glucose levels in people starting intensive diabetes management
