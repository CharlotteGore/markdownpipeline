Hy poglycaemia is, for most people using insulin therapy, an inevitable consequence of the erratic absorption of insulin from subcutaneous tissue after depot injection or infusion, c oupled with absence of feedback to insulin need when changes in planned activity or eating occur once the injection has been given. Hypoglycaemia is usually unpleasant, often becomes a source of fear, and can be an embarrassment as well as a safety risk. Accordingly, while careful ch oice of insulin regimen (section 7.3) informed by self-monitoring (section 6.2) is important in ameliorating this problem, other preventative measures are of importance. A higher level of optimised management is needed when hypoglycaemia and its related problems do occur.
