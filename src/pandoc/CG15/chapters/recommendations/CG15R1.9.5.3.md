Adults with decreased level of consciousness due to hypoglycaemia who are unable to take oral treatment safely should be:
? given intramuscular glucagon by a trained user (intravenous glucose may be used by professionals skilled in obtaining intravenous access)
? monitored for response at 10 minutes, and then given intravenous glucose if the level of consciousness is not improving significantly
? then given oral carbohydrate when it is safe to administer it, and placed under continued observation by a third party who has been warned of the risk of relapse.
