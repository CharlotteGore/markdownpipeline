Adults with Type 1 diabetes should be informed that some hypoglycaemic episodes are an inevitable consequence of insulin therapy in most people using any insulin regimen, and that it is advisable that they should use a regimen that avoids or reduces the frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes while maintaining as optimal a level of blood gl ucose control as is feasible. Advice to assist in obtaining the best such balance from any insulin regimen should be available to all adults with Type 1 diabetes. (see section 7.2, �Insulin regimens� and 7.2, �Insulin delivery�)
