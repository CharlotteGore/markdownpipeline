When hypoglycaemia becomes unusually problematic or of increased frequency,review should be made of the following possibly contributory causes:
? inappropriate insulin regimens (incorrect dose distributions and insulin types)
? meal and activity patterns including alcohol
? injection technique and skills including insulin resuspension
? injection site problems
? possible organic causes including gastroparesis
? changes in insulin sensitivity (the latter including drugs affecting the renin- angiotensin system and renal failure)
? psychological problems
? previous physical activity
? lack of appropriate knowledge and skills for self-management.
