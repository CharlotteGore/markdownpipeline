Nocturnal hypoglycaemia (symptomatic or detected on monitoring) should be managed by:
? reviewing knowledge and self-management skills
? reviewing current insulin regimen and evening eating habits and previous physical activity
? choosing an insulin type and regimen with less propensity to induce low glucose levels in the night hours, such as:
� isophane (NPH) insulin at bedtime
� rapid-acting analogue with the evening meal
� long-acting insulin analogues (insulin glargine)
� insulin pump
