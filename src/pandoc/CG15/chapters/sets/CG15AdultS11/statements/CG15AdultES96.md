The microvascular risk threshold is what determines the diagnostic threshold for diabetes. In theory, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) findings should give some guidance as to this threshold. Unfortunately these are mainly based on non-physiological glucose load findings, and set a top limit of risk for 2h post-prandial levels. Fasting levels have been set as a microvascular threshold of 7.0 mmol/l (based on epidemiological equivalence with 2h OGTT levels), which would map to a DCCT-harmonised HbA 1c of about 7.7%
