R eanalysis of the published DCCT curve 118 suggests no worsening of retinopathy rates from normal levels until HbA 1c >8.0%; the �low� rates (2% per 100 patient years) below that may be artefact for the reasons given above. The UKPDS (epidemiological analysis, Type 2 diabetes, microvascular disease) suffers much the same problems. 119 A similar level is found for r etinopathy of 2% per 100 patient years at an HbA 1c of 7.5% and of 1% per 100 patient years at a level of 6.5%
