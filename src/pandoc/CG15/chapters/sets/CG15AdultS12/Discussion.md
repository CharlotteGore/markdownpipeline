It was noted that Type 1 diabetes is a hormone deficiency disease. The problems faced by people w ith the condition (injections, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, consequences of capricious co ntrol, late complications) were noted to be solely a function of the poor state of insulin re placement therapy. The group noted that the use of insulin injections in people with Type 1 diabetes is not RCT- based and never could be. It was also noted that, prior to the introduction of short- and long- acting insulin analogues, the use of insulin regimens based on a combination in various forms of unmodified (soluble) human insulin befo re meals and human isophane (NPH) insulin for basal supply had become widespread, and that, the analogues aside, there was no evidence to ch allenge that conventional practice. Long-acting analogues, or rather insulin glargine, are co ve re d by NICE appraisal guidance, and this recommends their availability for use in people w ith Type 1 diabetes. Rapid-acting insulin analogues are supported by an evidence base for less hy poglycaemia at night and at some other times, reduced hyperglycaemic excursions after meals and small improvements in HbA 1c , suggesting that these too should have an increasing r ole in people with Type 1 diabetes. The group was aware that the evidence for combining the advantages of rapid- and long-acting insulin analogues was evolving as the knowledge base to use these technologies improves. This co mbination would be particularly suitable to matching with active mealtime insulin dose adjustment (AMIDA, see dietary recommendations in 6.3). Some recent NICE technology appraisals provided a health economic basis for supporting this regimen, should appropriate improvements in HbA 1c be demonstrated. Accordingly the recommendations were drafted to allow choice of human or combined analogue regimens including from the time of diagnosis. The group noted the potential usefulness of the new insulins in some special situations, including religious feasts and fasts, and shift work. A need to address insulin starters and people who wished for smaller numbers of injections was identified. A need to caution against using newer, more expensive insulins in people with control problems without proper assessment of underlying causes was felt appropriate. The NICE appraisal of insulin pumps (effectively an insulin regimen rather than a device) was noted, and no elaboration felt to be needed on that. The group found the evidence for the general recommendation of any glucose-lowering drug in combination with insulin to be unconvincing. While there may be a small gain in overall gl ucose control evidenced inconsistently in the acarbose studies, the size of this gain, the prevalence of intolerance, and the suggestion of increased hypoglycaemia, together were taken as indicating that no recommendation for the general use of this drug in this context could be made.  The use of metformin and insulin sensitisers in people with Type 1 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome has not been adequately investigated. The group was aware of the concern that arterial complications in people with Type 1 diabetes we re associated with features of the metabolic syndrome as seen in Type 2 diabetes, and that there was evidence of benefit in people with Type 2 diabetes for some drugs, notably metformin (UKPDS study) and PPAR- ? agonists (see NICE guidance). While not endorsing the general use of such drugs in people with Type 1 diabetes and features of the metabolic syndrome (see section 8.2, �Arterial disease management�), the group noted that further investigation might support the high a priori likelihood of benefit in this high-risk situation.
