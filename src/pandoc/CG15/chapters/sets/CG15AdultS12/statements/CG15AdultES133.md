The health economic searches produced no studies giving guidance on appropriate insulin re g imens for those newly-diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes or for the management and prevention of hypoglycaemia, with the exception of the NICE appraisal of insulin glargine. The health economic searches found no published papers dealing with insulin glargine or NPH insulin. A recent NICE technology appraisal 132 re co mmended insulin glargine as a long-acting preparation for people with Type 1 diabet es alongside insulin NPH. The crucial issue for the c ost-effectiveness of insulin glargine is the amount of utility associated with reducing the fear of hypoglycaemia. Tw o cost-benefit studies were identified that considered the role of insulin lispro. 342,380 Ne ither paper was based in the UK (Canada, Australia), and both suggest that the willingness to pay for insulin lispro will outweigh its additional cost. The cost-effectiveness of lispro is unclear and is likely to be most favourable amongst those who require increased flexibility in setting mealtimes, or those for whom mealtimes are often unpredictable. The issue of the cost-effectiveness of intensive insulin therapy is complicated by a shortage of unconfounded data. The DCCT showed that a series of interventions including intensive insulin therapy reduces the rate of diabetic complications and increases life expectancy amongst an unrepresentative sample of adults and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes. Because of the co mplexity of this intervention, health economic analysis of the DCCT data has typically assumed that these reductions are primarily due to intensive insulin regimens. The health economic searches found three models designed to find the cost-effectiveness of intensive treatment, 343�4,381 of which two attempted to form QALYs. The health utility values in each of the studies are poor: in one study 343 non-preference-based values are used; in another 381 only a very small sample was used to find health utilities. Both studies considered only a small number of health states and both suggest that intensive therapy is cost-effective.  Tw o models analysed intensive treatment in cost-per-life-year terms, and differed in their re sults. One study 343 produced a cost-per-life-year figure of US$28,661 at 1994 prices, whilst another 344 found a figure several times larger. Neither study used UK costs. Note that as several diabetic complications will affect quality of life but will not significantly shorten life expectancy, the cost-per-QALY figure may be lower than the corresponding cost-per-life-year figure. Two c ost analyses also suggest that the DCCT cost estimates may be overestimates. 345�6 Few inferences can be drawn because these studies are limited but it appears likely that intensive tr eatment, including intensive insulin regimens, will be cost-effective.
