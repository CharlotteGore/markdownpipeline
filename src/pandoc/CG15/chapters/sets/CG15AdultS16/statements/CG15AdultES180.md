Am erican Diabetes Association guidelines 76 indicate that meta-analysis and large-scale co llaborative trials in men and women with diabetes support the view that low-dose aspirin therapy should be prescribed as a secondary prevention strategy if no contraindications exist. The guidelines also point to substantial evidence suggesting that low-dose aspirin therapy should be used as a primary prevention strategy in men and women with diabetes who are at a high risk for arterial events. The meta-analysis of 145 prospective controlled trials of antiplatelet therapy by the Antiplatelet Tr ialists Group reported in the ADA guidelines 76 showed a trend toward increased risk re ductions with doses of aspirin = 325 mg/day, but the difference was not statistically significant. An estimated 38ï¿½12 vascular events per 1,000 patients with Type 1 diabetes would have been prevented if they were treated with aspirin as a secondary prevention strategy
