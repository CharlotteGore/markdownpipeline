The SIGN guideline 174 re ports on the results of the beta-blocker adrenergic pooling project study, which demonstrated that diabetes is not a contraindication to the use of beta-blockers, and that these reduce mortality, sudden cardiac death and re-infarction when given after acute MI. The guideline also cites the 1995 Collaborative Group on ACE inhibitor trials meta-analysis of nearly 100,000 patients which showed that receiving therapy with an ACE inhibitor within 36 hours of acute MI for = 4 weeks, reduced mortality post MI.
