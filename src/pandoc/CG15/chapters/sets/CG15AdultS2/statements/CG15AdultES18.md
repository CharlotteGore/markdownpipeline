Two potentially useful papers consider the type of treatment facility used to deliver care to those with Type 1 diabetes.334,335 One German study334 found that the treatment facility (polyclinics, specialist clinics or general practitioners) makes no difference to diabetes-specific knowledge when this was controlled for age, sex and education. One UK study335 found no difference between hospital- and general practice-based care on a range of outcome measures for metabolic control, satisfaction with treatment or beliefs about diabetic control for a mixed
diabetic population. Some differences were observed in the surveillance for complications, with more frequent testing in integrated care. Whilst costly, it is worth noting that fewer patients defaulted from general practice-based care than conventional care. Avoided complications may offset the increased cost of general practice-based care, although this cannot be established on the basis of this study. One UK-based study297 suggested that the provision of a hospital-based diabetes specialist nurse lowered the cost per patient admission without producing a significant difference in readmission, quality of life or patient satisfaction.
