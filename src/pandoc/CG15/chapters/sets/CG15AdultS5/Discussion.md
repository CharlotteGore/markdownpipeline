The group noted that patient education was a necessary and logical part of most aspects of diabetes self-care, and that self-care was a social, health and economic necessity in the manage- ment of the condition. Specific recommendations related to aspects of care such as self- monitoring, insulin therapy, foot care and nutrition were thought best presented in the individual sections of this guideline. The group noted inap propriateness of the classical clinical trial model when just one feature of an integrated pac kage was varied, and one of many possible outputs monitored as primary outcome. There is also the difficulty of, and lack of funding for, the larger, longer-term trials used for pharmaceutical interventions. Equally, the central role of education in achieving success in blood glucose control and health outcomes (DCCT and other key studies) c ould not be ignored. Such information suggested that educational interventions were likely to be c ost-effective, but it was impossible to make compar ative judgements of different education models, a conclusion seemingly also reached by the NICE Appraisal Committee on the basis of a re port from the University of Southampton�s health technology assessment unit. Is sues of information overload at the stressful time of diagnosis, the size of the longer-term educational needs of individuals, the diversity of individual needs, and the retention of the information needed to make informed choices, and the group�s experience of these in practice, served to guide recommendations broadly in line with those of Diabetes UK and the International Diabetes Federation (Europe).
