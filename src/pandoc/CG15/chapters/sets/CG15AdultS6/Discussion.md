Self-monitoring does not, in itself, appear to improve blood glucose control. However, the gr oup noted that it was an essential component of the markedly improved blood glucose control with improved outcomes demonstrated in the landmark DCCT study, and indeed in the other smaller studies of blood glucose control and complications. Indeed it was difficult for members of the group to conceive how modern flexible insulin dosage regimens could be adopted without it. However, the technique is not easy, painless or convenient, and as a result no one system is found appropriate for use by all individuals. Improved technical facility could be identified from clinical experience. Nevertheless appropriate training and quality of skills re vi ew is agreed as necessary and normal practice. Different individuals are noted to use this te c hnology with different frequencies and for different needs according to personal preferences. Given the nature of the technology it is rarely abused. A newer approach, using smaller blood samples from non-finger-prick sites, was not judged to have adequate evidence of reliability, particularly in the situation of hypoglycaemia, to allow a general recommendation.
