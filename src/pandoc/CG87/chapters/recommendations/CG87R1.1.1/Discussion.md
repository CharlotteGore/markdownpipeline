### Discussion
The GDG noted that the last review of this area by a HTA on behalf of NICE in 2003 looked at the evidence for structured education. Little robust evidence of the effectiveness of any particular educational approach for people with Type 2 diabetes was found. One conclusion was that further research was required, but meanwhile that educational programmes with a theoretical basis demonstrated improved outcomes, and that group education was a more effective use of resources and may have additional benefits.
