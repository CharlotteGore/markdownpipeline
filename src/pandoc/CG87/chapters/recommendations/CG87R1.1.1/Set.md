Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a progressive long-term medical condition that is predominantly
managed by the person with the diabetes and/or their carer as part of their daily life. Accordingly,
understanding of diabetes, informed choice of management opportunities, and the acquisition of
relevant skills for successful self-management play an important role in achieving optimal
outcomes. Delivery of these needs is not always assured by conventional clinical consultations.
Structured programmes have been designed not only to improve people s knowledge and skills,
but also to help motivate and sustain people with diabetes in taking control of their condition and
in delivering effective self-management.
