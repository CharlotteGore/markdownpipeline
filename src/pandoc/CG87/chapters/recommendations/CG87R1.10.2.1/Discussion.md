### Discussion
While the evidence was not as strong as for the statins, there was convincing evidence of the effectiveness of fibrates in CV protection in people with Type 2 diabetes. Some of the trials (e.g. FIELD) in which this evidence was found included people with TG levels down to the upper end of the normal range (~1.8 mmol/l). However, while the price of fibrates was considerably above that of generic statins, the more effective fibrates as judged by TG lowering were about half the price of proprietary statins when both are used at standard doses.  Hypertriglyceridaemia is a complex condition with both a genetic basis and often being secondary to other medical conditions, including poor blood glucose control. The GDG recognised it was not writing a guideline on management of hypertriglyceridaemia in people with Type 2 diabetes, but because of the interaction with blood glucose control and other medical conditions often associated with Type 2 diabetes (including renal impairment and liver disease), it could not avoid some general guidance in the area. 
In drawing up the recommendations the GDG was also cognisant of the need to be aware of: 

*   the likely combination with statin therapy (given its recommendations on statins) and the
higher rate of side effects of combined usage 

*   the more immediate risks of pancreatitis with higher levels of TGs

*   the difficulty of assessing LDL-C levels when TG levels were above 4.5 mmol/l. A useful
pragmatic compromise was felt to be to base recommendations around cut-off levels of
2.3 and 4.5 mmol/l. There is evidence of differences between fibrates: gemfibrozil had greater interactions with
other drugs commonly used in diabetes care; bezafibrate was cheaper and less effective in TG
lowering and with a poorer CV evidence base than fenofibrate; and ciprofibrate was more poorly investigated. Therefore recommendations were based around fenofibrate, though with a role for bezafibrate where CV risk was less pronounced, and ciprofibrate as an alternative. Further information on fibrate statin combinations might become available when the ACCORD trial reports.35
