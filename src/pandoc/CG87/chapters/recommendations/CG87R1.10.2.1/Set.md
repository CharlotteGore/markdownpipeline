Fibrates have a long and controversial history as lipid-lowering agents, beginning with clofibrate
over 30 years ago and being implicated in the problems which led to withdrawal of cerivastatin
in the 1990s. However, bezafibrate, fenofibrate and ciprofibrate have shown considerable staying
power in the market. Statins have, however, eclipsed fibrates as primary cholesterol-lowering
agents, so the issues surrounding fibrates relate to specific lipid abnormalities. In clinical practice
these mostly concern hypertriglyceridaemia, itself strongly associated with low HDL-C levels,
this problem being particularly common in people with Type 2 diabetes (more so than raised
LDL-C levels).
The clinical question then relates to whether and when a fibrate should be initiated before statin
therapy, and the circumstances under which a fibrate should be added to, or substituted for,
statin therapy
