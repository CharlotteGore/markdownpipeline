Cholesterol lowering remained difficult, and indeed controversial, until the late 1980s when statins became available. Subsequently these drugs became the mainstay of lipid-lowering therapy, supported eventually by CV outcome studies. As discussed above, people with Type 2 diabetes are at high CV risk, and most of their morbidity and increased mortality comes from coronary, cerebral, and peripheral arterial disease. In earlier NICE technology appraisals (TAs) and the prior Type 2 diabetes guideline, statins were recommended for all people with extant CVD or at high risk thereof, states which include most people with Type 2 diabetes.283 Clinical questions which arise include whether more potent and more expensive statins should ever be used (and if so when), the use of statins in younger people with Type 2 diabetes, whether any people should not be routinely given statins, and the use of alternatives such as fibrates (addressed in the following fibrate section) and ezetimibe addressed by a 2007 NICE TA.2
