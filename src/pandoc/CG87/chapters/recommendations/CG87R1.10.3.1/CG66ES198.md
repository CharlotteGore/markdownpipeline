### Evidence Statement CG66ES198
One study considered nicotinic acid 1,500 mg/day compared with pravastatin 40 mg/day, followed by a combination therapy phase of nicotinic acid 1,000 mg/day with pravastatin 20 mg/day. This study included both diabetic and non-diabetic participants (N=11, Type 2 diabetes).307 This study considered the results for lipid profiles for the combined diabetic and non-diabetic participants. The glycaemic effect results were considered separately for diabetic and non-diabetic participants.   Lipid profiles
Nicotinic acid was not found to be more effective than pravastatin as the later showed significant reductions in LDL and TC levels compared with nicotinic acid. Combination therapy showed significant decreases in LDL, TC and TG levels compared with nicotinic acid and significant increases in HDL and decreases in TG levels compared with pravastatin. Level 1+
