### Discussion
This group of drugs was not considered in the previous guideline (2002).414 The limitednumber of studies presented suggested that nicotinic acid can have some advantageous effect on serum HDL-C and lipids, but also that it has some negative effects on blood glucose control. In the absence of outcome trials in people with Type 2 diabetes, and given also the problems of using the current preparations (notably flushing despite prophylactic aspirin, dose titration and use of modified-release preparations), no general recommendation could be given for use of nicotinic acid. The group were aware of some possible special indications in people with extreme hypertriglyceridaemia, but felt this to be outside the remit of the current guideline.
