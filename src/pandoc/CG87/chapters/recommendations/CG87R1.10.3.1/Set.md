Abnormalities of blood lipid profiles, including serum HDL-C and TGs, are recognised CV riskfactors, and are particularly likely to be abnormal in people with Type 2 diabetes. Nicotinic acid preparations are one approach to improving lipid profiles. Nicotinic acid administration isassociated with side effects due to vasodilatation, and derivatives (acipimox) and modified-release preparations have been made available to try and reduce the problem. The clinical question is then what role nicotinic acid derivatives might have in the management of Type 2 diabetes.
