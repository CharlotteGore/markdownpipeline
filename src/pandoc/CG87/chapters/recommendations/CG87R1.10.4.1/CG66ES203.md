### Evidence Statement CG66ES203
A subgroup analysis was undertaken with the hypertriglyceridaemic participants, doses of fish oil and trial duration.
Hypertriglyceridaemic participants (control TGs >4 mmol/l)
An increased reduction in TGs was identified in trials (N=3) with only hypertriglyceridaemic participants; 1.45 mmol/l (2.89 to 0.01, p=0.05), compared with studies with non hypertriglyceridaemic participants (N=11) 0.40 mmol/l (0.61 to 0.19, p=0.0002). Increases in LDL-C levels were significant in the hypertriglyceridaemic groups (N=2 trials), 0.6 mmol/l (0.16 to 1.04, p=0.008), but they were NS in the non-hypertriglyceridaemic groups(N=9 trials). Dose of fish oil
Trials with high doses of fish oil (>2 g EPA, N=4) showed a significant increase in LDL-C
0.51 mmol/l (0.18 to 0.84, p=0.003), this was NS for lower doses (<2 g EPA, N=7).
Levels of TGs in the high-dose groups decreased by 1.11 mmol/l (2.21 to 0.10, p=0.03), but
in the low-dose group this was less at 0.54 mmol/l (0.69 to 0.38, p<0.00001).
Trial duration
In trials of longer than 2 months LDL-C levels increased by 0.33 mmol/l (0.00 to 0.65, p=0.05), the increases were NS in trials shorter than 2 months. TG levels were reduced by 0.81 mmol/l (1.21 to 0.41, p=0.00008) in the longer trials and by less than 0.36 (0.58 to 0.13, p=0.002) in the shorter ones. Level 1++
