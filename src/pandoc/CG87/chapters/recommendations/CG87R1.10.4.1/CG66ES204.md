exercise) the inclusion of a daily fish meal significantly reduced TGs, 0.91.3 mmol/l,
p=0.0001, with fish/moderate exercise reducing by 1.210.3 mmol/l and fish/light exercise by
1.220.3 mmol/l p=0.0001. The addition of exercise without the fish also showed a significant
decrease in TGs 0.70.3 mmol/l, p=0.03, compared with the control.317 HDL-C (subgroups)
The study which included fish meals found that high-density lipoprotein 2 cholesterol (HDL2-C)
was significantly increased, 0.06 mmol/l, p=0.01 and high-density lipoprotein 3 cholesterol
(HDL3-C) significantly reduced by the inclusion of fish compared with the low-fat control group,
0.05 mmol/l, p=0.01.317 Level 1+
