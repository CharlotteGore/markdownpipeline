### Discussion
From the evidence available fish oils as a homogeneous therapeutic concept is problematic, as the evidence included showed a variation in the fish oil dosage used. Clinical experience confirmed that large total doses of oils used to get an adequate dose of omega 3 fish oils in some preparations can cause adverse effects. From the evidence available omega 3 fish oil preparations could help lower TG levels, but overall showed minimal improvement in lipid profiles in people who had not had a MI. The GDG agreed there were financial consequences in prescribing omega 3 supplements when the evidence showed no clear benefit.
It was recognised that the recommendations made must be understood as only applying for omega 3 fish oil supplementation, and not to recommendations on sources of dietary fats.
