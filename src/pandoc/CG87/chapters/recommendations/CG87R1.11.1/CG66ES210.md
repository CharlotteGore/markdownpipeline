### Evidence Statement CG66ES210
The authors acknowledged several limitations of this sub-analysis:

*   compared with the original CAPRIE primary cluster endpoints this was a different
endpoint (softer according to the authors)

*   the study was not sufficiently powered to allow identification of specific individual
endpoints

*   the duration and severity of diabetes were unknown

*   specific details regarding control of diabetes, such as glycosylated haemoglobin levels or
glycaemic control were not collected. Level 1+
