Antiplatelet therapy now has an established role in the management of people at high risk of
cardiovascular (CV) events. People with Type 2 diabetes are known to have CV risk higher than
matched populations after allowance for other CV risk factors, and in some studies as high as
those without diabetes who have declared cardiovascular disease (CVD).273 National guidelines
and the previous NICE (inherited) Type 2 diabetes guideline recommend use of aspirin in people
at high CV risk.319,320 Other antiplatelet agents (clopidogrel and dipyridamole modified release
(MR)) have been the subject of a NICE technology appraisal (TA) but without specific calculation
for the higher CV event rate or the specific risk reduction in people with Type 2 diabetes.321 The
increasing occurrence of Type 2 diabetes in younger people raises the additional question of the
use of antiplatelet therapy in those who CV risk may be not be very high.
The guidelines are not concerned with the use of antiplatelet therapy after acute cardiological
events or cardiac interventions, or after acute cerebrovascular events. 
The clinical question then is whether antiplatelet medications should be used in people with
Type 2 diabetes, or in which subgroups of such people, and if so which agents and in what doses.
