### Evidence Statement CG66ES230
The study344 concluded that the MDRD and CG equations were significantly more biased in
people with GFR >60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (N=117). The MDRD equation underestimated the
measured eGFR, while the CG equation significantly overestimated the GFR (3.5 vs 7.9
ml/min per 1.73 m2, p<0.001). The equations were also biased, but to a lesser extent in patients
with GFR 3060 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Level 2+
