### Evidence Statement CG66ES233
One study345 showed that over the whole population the mean isotopic GFR was
56.534.9 ml/min/1.73 m2, the mean CG 61.235.6 (p<0.01 vs isotopic), the mean MCG.
60.029.9 (p<0.05 vs isotopic) and the mean MDRD, 51.024.3 (p<0.001 vs isotopic). The
MCG was better correlated with isotopic GFR than was the CG (CG: r=0.75, MCG: r=0.83;
p<0.05 vs CG, MDRD: r=0.82; p=0.068 vs CG). Level 2+
