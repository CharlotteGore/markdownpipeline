### Evidence Statement CG66ES239
One study343 comparing the Micral-Test II with UAER (in a 24-hour timed urine collection)
reported a sensitivity 88% and a specificity 80%. 
When performance was assessed by different concentrations readings the study found that
Micral-Test II strips performed reasonably well at 0.50 and 100 mg/l with a high percentage of
true negatives (93%, 0 mg/l), true positives (81%, 50 mg/l and 91%, 100 mg/l), low percentages
of false negatives (7%, 0 mg/l) and false positives (19%, 50 mg/l and 9%, 100 mg/l). However,
at 20 mg/l Micral strips did not perform well (51% false positive). Level 2+
