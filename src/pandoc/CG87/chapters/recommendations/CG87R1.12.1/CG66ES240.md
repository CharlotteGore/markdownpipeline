### Evidence Statement CG66ES240
One study340 assessing the accuracy of the Micral-Test II, the UAC and the ACR in a random
urine specimen found the following test correlations:

*   UAER vs UAC: 0.76 p<0.0001

*   UAER vs ACR: 0.74 p<0.0001

*   ACR vs UAC: 0.86 p<0.0001
The study340 also reported that age and 24-hour creatinuria presented a negative correlation
(278 patients, r=0.19, p=0.002). No correlation was observed between age and UAER (r=0.02,
p=0.74), age and UAC (r=0.07, p=0.22) and age and UACR (r=0.11, p=0.08). Level 2+
