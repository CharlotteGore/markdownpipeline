### Evidence Statement CG66ES242
In terms of accuracy, the study340 stated that the comparison among the areas under the ROC
curves for UAC, UACR and the Micral-Test II took into account the individual results, for each
single patient (N=130), of the three screening methods being tested and of the reference test
method (UAER).The study concluded that a similar area was observed under the UAC
(0.9340.032) and UACR (0.9200.035) curves (p=0.626). 
The area under the curve was smaller for the Micral-Test II (0.8460.047) than for UAC
(p=0.014). Level 2+
