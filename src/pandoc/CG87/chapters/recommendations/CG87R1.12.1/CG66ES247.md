### Evidence Statement CG66ES247
The study337 showed that group A presented a significantly higher prevalence of normal and
raised GFR (25.8% and 61.3%). Group B had a significantly higher prevalence of low GFR,
while prevalence of very low GFR was highest in group C (37.9%). 
The GFR had a progressively significant decrement from group A through group B to C
(p<0.01). Level 2+
The study337 concluded that GFR estimation was the only renal parameter which could singly
provide a picture of the actual renal status of Type 2 diabetes patients at any duration
irrespective of the status of albuminuria, azotaemia or renal size and morphology as their
variability or progression is non-linear
