### Evidence Statement CG66ES249
The study338 found that of the 1,296 individuals with an eGFR <60, 539 (42%) had abnormal
serum creatinine, 579 (45%) had abnormal albuminuria and 798 (62%) had either abnormal
serum creatinine or urine ACR. Thus, a creatinine and ACR based strategy would have missed
the renal risk of 498 (38%) individuals since they had normal values of both despite having a
significantly impaired eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Level 2+
