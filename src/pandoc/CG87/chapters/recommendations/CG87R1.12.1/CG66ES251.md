### Evidence Statement CG66ES251
When the study analysed the data by ethnic origin, it was found that white people appeared
to benefit the most from eGFR, with a greater prevalence of normocreatinaemic and
normoalbuminuric renal insufficiency, whereas the majority of the African-Caribbean group with
low eGFR had either an abnormal creatinine or ACR 39%, 42% and 59% respectively, with
abnormal creatinine, ACR and either in white people (N=997); 62%, 69% and 80% respectively,
in African-Caribbeans (N=84); and 44%, 54% and 69% respectively in Indo-Asians (N=210).
Level 2+
