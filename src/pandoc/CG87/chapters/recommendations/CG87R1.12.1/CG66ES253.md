### Evidence Statement CG66ES253
The study338 concluded that GFR estimates may have a place in routine diabetes clinical care,
being a more sensitive marker of risk than serum creatinine or albuminuria. eGFR also appears
to eliminate the gender and ethnic bias observed with current markers and also provides an
opportunity to monitor longitudinal changes.
