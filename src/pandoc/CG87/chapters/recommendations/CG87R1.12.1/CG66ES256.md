### Evidence Statement CG66ES256
The same study also reported that unidentified CKD, defined as the presence of a GFR
<60 ml/min/1.73 m2 but without any evidence of an abnormal creatinine (i.e. serum creatinine
120 mmol/l) was significantly greater in females compared with males adjusting for age, type
of diabetes and secondary care setting (OR 8.22, CI 6.56 to 10.29). Using albuminuria as a
screening test also failed to identify CKD in females (OR 2.22, CI 1.63 to 3.03). The presence of
abnormal serum creatinine and albuminuria to identify CKD continued to display a significant
bias against females (OR 7.58, CI 5.44 to 10.57). Level 2+
