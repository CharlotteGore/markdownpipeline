### Evidence Statement CG66ES257
The study342 concluded that current screening techniques based upon albuminuria and/or
abnormal serum creatinine would fail to detect a significant number of participants with an
eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2. Therefore, without eGFR reporting the clinician may not be alerted
to the presence of CKD and be falsely reassured that renal function is normal.
