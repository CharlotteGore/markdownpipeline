### Evidence Statement CG66ES261
The study also demonstrated that normoalbuminuric patients were significantly older (p<0.01)
and more commonly female (p<0.01) in comparison to those with macroalbuminuria. There
were no differences in the duration of diabetes, BMI, prevalence of retinopathy, history of CVD,
smoking history, HbA1c levels, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), total
cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels among
patients with a GFR <60 ml/min 1.73 m2 associated with normo-, micro-, or macroalbuminuria.
