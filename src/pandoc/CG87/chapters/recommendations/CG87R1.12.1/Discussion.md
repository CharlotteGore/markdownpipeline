### Discussion
Kidney disease in people with Type 2 diabetes is becoming an ever larger health burden.336This reflects a number of trends including the increasing prevalence of people with diabetes, the better cardiovascular (CV) survival with modern management, and the better management of progression of kidney damage itself. The trend to younger onset of Type 2 diabetes is also likely to see more kidney damage as these people are at lower CV risk, while in the elderly the condition is ever more complicated by comorbidities disease.  Primary prevention of kidney damage from diabetes centres around the prevention of microvascular (classical diabetic nephropathy) and arterial (and thus renovascular) damage discussed in other chapters of this guideline  the current section is concerned with detection and secondary prevention of kidney damage. For reasons of coherence some recommendations overlap with, or are reproduced from, other sections of the guideline. 
The clinical questions addressed here include how often and by what means to detect and confirm the possibility of diabetic renal disease, and the means of monitoring its progression. In those with detected renal disease issues arise as to the means to reduce or stop such progression, and the point at which to engage specialist renal management.
