## Fist pass morning urine specimen
Ask all people with or without detected nephropathy to bring in a first-pass morning urine specimen once a year. In the absence of proteinuria/urinary tract infection (UTI), send this for laboratory estimation of albumin:creatinine ratio. Request a specimen on a subsequent visit if UTI prevents analysis.
