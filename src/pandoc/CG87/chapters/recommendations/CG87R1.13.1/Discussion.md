### Discussion
It was noted that management in this area was largely determined by practice for all people with diabetes and not just those with Type 2 diabetes. Indeed retinopathy screening programmes to
be provided on a local community basis were a key early target of the National Service Framework (NSF) for diabetes, and since that time the UK National Screening Programme has published and updated a workbook on Essential elements in developing a diabetic retinopathy screening programme for the guidance of health authorities and primary care trusts in England (fourth edition, January 2007).347 These observations, and a lack of awareness amongst experts of new publications that might affect recommendations on retinopathy screening, led to the conclusion that recommendations
for people with Type 2 diabetes should closely follow those for Type 1 diabetes (NICE guideline 2004),26 which themselves were largely based on generic evidence independent of type of diabetes. 
Accordingly the recommendations of the Type 1 diabetes guidelines, and the evidence
statements underlying them were reviewed, together with the national screening document.
There are no significant changes from the Type 1 diabetes recommendations.
