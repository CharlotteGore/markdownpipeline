Diabetes eye damage is the single largest cause of blindness before old age with a progressive
incidence in people with Type 2 diabetes.346 The success of laser therapy in the treatment of
sight-threatening retinopathy is an accepted part of ophthalmological care and has not been
assessed for this guideline. 
Appropriate clinical questions to be addressed are, however, how people with developing
retinopathy can be selected for ophthalmological referral in time for optimal treatment, and
whether preventative therapy other than good blood glucose, good blood pressure, and good
blood lipid control can be useful in people with Type 2 diabetes.
