## When to enquire re development of neuropathic symptoms
Make a formal enquiry annually about the development of neuropathic symptoms causing distress. Discuss the cause and prognosis (including possible medium-term remission) of troublesome neuropathic symptoms, if present (bearing in mind alternative diagnoses). Agree appropriate therapeutic options and review understanding at each clinical contact.
