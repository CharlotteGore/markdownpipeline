Neuropathic pain is a troublesome symptom of chronic exposure to poor blood glucose control that cannot be managed acutely by restoration of blood glucose control. It can take many forms, and is often distressing and sometimes depressing, particularly if symptoms are predominantly nocturnal and disturb sleep. People with diabetes may be reluctant to report the symptoms to those with expertise in diabetes care, because of lack of awareness that the problem is diabetes related. A number of drug and non-drug approaches to management are available, this diversity reflecting that none of them are fully effective.
Clinically the issues are when to start specific drug therapy for neuropathic pain, which medications to use, and in what order to try them.
