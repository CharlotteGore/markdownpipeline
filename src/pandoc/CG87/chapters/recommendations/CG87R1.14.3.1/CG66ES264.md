### Evidence Statement CG66ES264
One crossover study with 10 participants with diabetes and known prolonged gastric emptying were given 200 mg of IV erythromycin or IV placebo.383 Ten age and sex matched health participants were also used as a comparator group. This study used scintigraphic studies and found that for 60 and 120 minutes IV erythromycin significantly increased gastric emptying, (measured as the mean percentage simultaneously ingested food retained in the stomach, for solids), compared with placebo (215 vs 857, p<0.0005 and 41 vs 639, p<0.0005 respectively). For liquids the mean percentage retained was significantly lower for the IV erythromycin compared with placebo again at both 60 and 120 minutes (225 vs 545, p<0.0005 and 93 vs 324, p<0.005 respectively).247
IV erythromycin was also found to have increased gastric emptying for solids at 60 minutes
when compared with healthy subjects in the comparator group (p<0.05).
There were no AEs found with this study, this study had a further open-label phase with oral
erythromycin, not reported here. Level 1+
