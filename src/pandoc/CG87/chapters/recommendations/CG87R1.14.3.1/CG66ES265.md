### Evidence Statement CG66ES265
Two studies,384,385 one of which was a crossover study,384 were identified comparing oralmetoclopramide 10 mg QID and placebo, both studies used the diary recording of symptoms and though the scales used were broadly similar they were not identical, there were no major AEs identified in either study.* One study identified that the mean symptom scores for the 3-week treatment phase was significantly less for metoclopramide than for placebo; 26.53.7 vs 45.37.8, p<0.01. This study also found that the mean individual scores for 4/5 symptoms (fullness, pressure and bloating, nausea, vomiting, anorexia) showed that metoclopramide significantly reduced the symptoms compared with placebo (p<0.05).385 The crossover study found that symptom improvement was significantly greater for metoclopramide than placebo for nausea at weeks 1 and 3 (p<0.05). This was also found for fullness at weeks 2 and 3 (p<0.05). Changes found for other symptoms were not significantly improved for metoclopramide compared with placebo.384 Level 1+
