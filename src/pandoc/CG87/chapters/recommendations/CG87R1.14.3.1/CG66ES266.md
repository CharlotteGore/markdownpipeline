### Evidence Statement CG66ES266
One study386 considered domperidone vs placebo, this study combined a 4-week period where participants took 20 mg domperidone QID (single-blind phase) orally, followed by a 4-week period of 20 mg domperidone QID or placebo (double-blind phase). Entry into the second phase was dependent on a decrease on the baseline symptom score, those classed as responders, following completion of the single-blind phase. Single-blind phase: significant symptomatic improvement was found at the end of the singleblind phase (p<0.0001). Improvements were also noted in the health-related quality of life measured on the SF-36 scale (all domains p<0.001, except physical functioning, p<0.01). Double-blind phase: symptom severity increased with both domperidone and placebo, though they did not return to baseline levels, this increase in severity was greater for placebo compared with domperidone (p<0.05). AEs were not reported. Level 1+
