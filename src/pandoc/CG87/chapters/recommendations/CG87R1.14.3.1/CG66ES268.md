### Evidence Statement CG66ES268
One study with 95 participants considered domperidone 20 mg QID with metoclopramide 10 mg QID. Gastroparetic symptoms and tolerability were assessed, it should be noted for tolerability assessment participants were specifically asked about central nervous system (CNS) associated side effects; these have previously been identified in association with metoclopramide. Although significant reductions in symptoms were found with both domperidone and metoclopramide, there was no significant difference found between the two treatments. For tolerability, at week 2 the severity of somnolence (p<0.001), akathisia (p=0.03), anxiety (p=0.02) and depression (p=0.05) were significantly greater for metoclopramide than for domperidone (p<0.001-0.05). While at week 4 this was found for severity of somnolence (p=0.03) and reduced mental acuity (p=0.04). Level 1+
