### Discussion
The evidence reported had methodological limitations, notably studies of small sample sizes.The GDG agreed that there is a poor evidence base for the treatment of gastroparesis. Nevertheless they noted that the evidence reported suggested that the prokinetic drugs, metoclopramide, domperidone, along with erythromycin, were all effective in at least some people with gastroparesis resulting from autonomic neuropathy. On consideration of the evidence it was not possible to distinguish usefully between the prokinetic drugs. The group agreed that choice of initial therapy should be based on tolerability issues, including drug interactions. It was noted that differential diagnosis can be difficult, and the diagnostic tests not secure, while serious prolonged vomiting could become a medical emergency. Accordingly referral beyond diabetes services is sometimes indicated.
While the group gave priority to medication for the management of this condition, clinical experience suggested that non-pharmacological approaches including postural advice and timing of ingestion of fluids and solids could prove useful to some people.
