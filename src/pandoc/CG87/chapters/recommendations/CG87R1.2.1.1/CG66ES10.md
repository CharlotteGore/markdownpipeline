### Evidence Statement CG66ES10
Barnard et al.14 investigated the effects of a low-fat vegan diet compared with a diet based on
ADA guidelines, on body weight and glycaemic control in an RCT with 99 Type 2 diabetics,
followed up for 22 weeks. During the study period, 43% (21/49) of vegan participants and
26% (13/50) of ADA participants reduced their diabetic medications, mainly as a result of
hypoglycaemia. Eight per cent in each group, 4/49 of the vegan group and 4/50 of the ADA
group, increased their medications.
The study concluded that for the whole sample, body weight was reduced in both groups by 5.8 kg
in the vegan group and 4.3 kg in the ADA group, but this difference was not statistically significant
(p=0.082). In those whose medication was stable this difference was significant with a 6.5 kg
reduction in the vegan group, and 3.1 kg in the ADA group, p<0.001. BMI declined by
2.11.5 kg/m2 in the vegan group and by 1.51.5 kg/m2 in the ADA group (p=0.08). The waistto-
hip ratio declined in the vegan group 0.020.01 but not in the ADA group (p=0.003). Level 1+
