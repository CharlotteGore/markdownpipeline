### Evidence Statement CG66ES11
With respect to glycaemic control, the RCT stated that while the HbA1c decline in both groups
was statistically significant from their baseline values with a decline of 0.96% (p<0.0001) in the
vegan group and 0.56% (p=0.0009) in the ADA group, there was no significant difference
between the groups (p=0.089). Again the results were different in those participants whose
medication was unchanged. The HbA1c decline was greater in the vegan group, 1.231.38%,
than in the ADA group, 0.381.11%, (p=0.01). Level 1+
