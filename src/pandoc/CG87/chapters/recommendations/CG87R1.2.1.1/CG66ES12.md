### Evidence Statement CG66ES12

between eating behaviour and long-term weight gain. Ninety-seven Type 2 diabetics were
recruited at diagnosis and after initial nutrition advice were followed up for a period of 4 years.
The study found that at the end of follow-up, mean body weight change in men was a gain of
1.35.4 kg, whereas in women, there was a mean body weight reduction of 1.15.0 kg. These
changes were not statistically significant, (p values not given). Similarly, BMI increased in men
by 0.421.76 kg/m2 and decreased in women by 0.401.89 kg/m2, (p values not given).
Glycaemic outcomes were not reported. Level 2+
