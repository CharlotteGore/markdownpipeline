reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in both groups. In the vegan group systolic
blood pressure decreased by 3.812.6 mmHg (p<0.05) compared with baseline and in the ADA
group by 3.613.7 mmHg from baseline, with no significant difference between the groups
(p=0.93). Similarly the reduction in diastolic blood pressure was greater in the vegan group,
5.18.3 mmHg (p<0.0001) than in the ADA group 3.38.8 mmHg (p<0.05) although this was
not different between groups (p=0.30). Level 1+
