### Evidence Statement CG66ES2
An RCT comparing a soy-based meal replacement with an individualised diet based on ADA
recommendations in obese Type 2 diabetics13 found that average weight reduction in the meal
replacement group was greater than that in the individualised diet group. At 6 months, the meal
32 Type 2 diabetes replacement group had lost on average 5.240.60 kg, and the individualised diet group had lost an average of 2.850.67 kg (p=0.0031). At 1 year this difference was not significant with the meal replacement group losing on average 4.350.81 kg and the individualised diet group
losing an average of 2.360.76 kg (p=0.0670). Level 1+
