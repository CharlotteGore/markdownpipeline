### Evidence Statement CG66ES20
For the entire sample, although lipid parameters decreased significantly from baseline values,
there were no significant differences between groups. Among those whose lipid controlling
medications remained constant (vegan N=39/49; ADA N=41/50), total cholesterol reduced in
the vegan groups by 33.521.5 mg/dl (p<0.0001), in the ADA group by 19.028.5 mg/dl
(p<0.0001) and this was a significantly different between groups (p=0.01). Reductions in HDL
cholesterol were not significantly different between the groups.
Reductions in non-HDL cholesterol were significantly lower than baseline in the vegan groups
27.621.1 mg/dl (p<0.0001) and in the ADA group 16.330.1 mg/dl (p<0.05), but not
significantly different between the groups (p=0.05).
LDL cholesterol reduced in the vegan group by 22.622.0 mg/dl (p<0.0001) and in the ADA
group by 10.723.3 mg/dl (p<0.05), and was significantly different between the groups (p=0.02).
The total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio and triglyceride concentrations fell for both groups, but there
was no difference between the groups. Level 1+
