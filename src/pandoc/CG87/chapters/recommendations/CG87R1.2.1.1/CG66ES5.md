### Evidence Statement CG66ES5
In relation to glycaemic control, the study showed that at 1 year, HbA1c had declined from a
baseline of 8.10.2% to 7.50.3% in the combination therapy group but had remained
unchanged at 8.20.2% in the standard therapy group, and this difference was significant
(p=0.05). After adjusting for medication changes, this difference remained significant. In an
analysis of those participants whose medication had not changed, it was found that there was a
significant positive linear association between change in weight at 1 year and change in HbA1c
(r=0.53; p=0.006). A 5 kg decrease in weight at 1 year was associated with a 0.4%
