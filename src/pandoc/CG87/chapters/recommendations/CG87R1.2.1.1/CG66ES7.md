### Evidence Statement CG66ES7
Studies that compared a meal replacement intervention with a reduced calorie diet
The RCT by Li et al.,13 reporting on the comparison of a soy-based meal replacement plan with
an individualised diet plan, did not report on changes in blood pressure during the study.
For the blood lipid control outcomes, while there were no significant differences between
groups during the study for lipid parameters, there were differences within the groups when
compared to baseline values. In the meal replacement group, there were decreases in total
cholesterol, triglycerol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) at
the end of the study, however these changes were only significant in the triglycerol group with
an overall decrease from baseline of 28.00 mg/dl (p=0.038). Decreases in total cholesterol were
significant at 3 (p<0.0001) and 6 (p=0.0037) months, but at 12 months with a reduction of
10.76 mg/dl from baseline, this was not significant (p=0.084). LDL decreased by 11.04 mg/dl at
3 months (p=0.024), but at 12 months the change from baseline had reduced to 6.10 mg/dl
(p=0.255). HDL had decreased by 0.97 mg/dl at 12 months (p=0.345). In the individualised
diet plan group, after initial decreases at 3 or 6 months, at 12 months there were increases in
total cholesterol by 5.26 mg/dl (p=0.396), LDL by 8.76 mg/dl (p=0.129) and HDL by 2.26 mg/dl
(p=0.012). Only in triglycerol levels was there a sustained decreased at 12 months with a
reduction from baseline of 28.89 mg/dl (p=0.119). Level 1+
