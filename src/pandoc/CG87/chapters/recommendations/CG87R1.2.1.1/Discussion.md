### Discussion
The GDG noted that there was little new evidence to warrant any change to previous views in this field. The major consensus-based recommendations from the UK and USA emphasise sensible practical implementation of nutritional advice for people with Type 2 diabetes. Other relevant NICE guidance should be considered where relevant, including clinical guideline no. 43 on the assessment and management of overweight and obesity in adults and children and clinical guideline no. 48 which gives dietary and lifestyle advice post-MI. Overlap with the NICE/RCP Type 1 diabetes guideline was noted. Management otherwise will concentrate on principles of healthy eating (essentially those for optimal cardiovascular risk protection), and reduction of high levels of free carbohydrate in food that are hyperglycaemic in the presence of defective insulin secretory reserve.
