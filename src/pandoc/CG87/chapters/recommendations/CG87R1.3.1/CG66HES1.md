### Evidence Statement CG66HES1
The UKPDS included an analysis of intensive blood glucose control with metformin for
overweight patients compared to conventional treatment primarily with diet. The study
included 753 overweight (>120% ideal body weight) patients with newly diagnosed Type 2
diabetes from 15 hospital-based clinics in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Of these
patients 342 were allocated to an intensive blood glucose control policy with metformin and
411 were allocated to conventional treatment, primarily with diet alone. The study was
conducted from 1977 to 1991. The median follow-up period was 10.4 years.
