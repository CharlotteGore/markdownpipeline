### Evidence Statement CG66HES2
In the conventional policy group the glycaemic goal was to obtain the lowest fasting plasma
glucose (FPG) attainable with diet alone. In the intensive policy group the aim was a FPG of less
than 6.0 mmol/l by increasing the dose of metformin from 500 to 2,550 mg a day as required.
Use of metformin for intensive blood glucose control in overweight patients was found to
confer a 32% risk reduction for any diabetes related endpoint and a 42% risk reduction for
diabetes related deaths compared with a conventional policy.
