### Evidence Statement CG66HES5
The discounted cost of intensive blood glucose control policy with metformin in overweight
patients was on average 1,021 less than the conventional policy and had a longer discounted
life expectancy of 0.55 QALYs, making this intensive treatment strategy both cost-saving and
more effective.34
