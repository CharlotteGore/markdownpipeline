The risk of arterial disease and microvascular complications in people with diabetes are known
to be related to the extent of hyperglycaemia with time. While the lifestyle, oral agent, and
injectable therapies discussed in this guideline can improve blood glucose control, their efficacy
is limited, as the underlying pathogenesis of diabetes worsens with time. As symptoms are not
a reliable guide to blood glucose control in people on therapy, it is important to have an
accurate means of measuring blood glucose control over time, to enable decision-making.
This section addresses the clinical questions as to the tests of blood glucose control best
predictive of future vascular damage from diabetes, the nature of the relationship between test
results and such vascular risk, how tests should be deployed in clinical practice, and how they
might be interpreted.
