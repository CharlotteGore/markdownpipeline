### Evidence Statement CG66ES27
Even though the Cochrane reviews37,38 were not able to meta-analyse the data (due to clinical
and methodological heterogeneity) the authors concluded that SMBG might be effective in
improving glycaemic control in patients with Type 2 diabetes who are not using insulin.
Authors also stated that a well designed large RCT assessing the benefits (including patientrelated
outcomes) of SMBG alongside patient education is required. Level 1+
