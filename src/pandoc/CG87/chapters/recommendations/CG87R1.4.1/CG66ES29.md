### Evidence Statement CG66ES29
In an indirect analysis, Jansen39 found a non-significant reduction in HbA1c of 0.3% when
interventions with SMBG were compared with those associated with SMUG.
The study by Jansen also reported that interventions with SMBG were found to be more
effective in reducing HbA1c than interventions without self-monitoring. The reduction in
HbA1c was statistically significant and it was estimated to be around 0.4%. This effect was
increased when regular feedback was added to the SMBG and was shown in both an insulintreated
Type 2 diabetes group, and in a group of Type 2 diabetes patients that included those
being treated with oral agents. Level 1+
