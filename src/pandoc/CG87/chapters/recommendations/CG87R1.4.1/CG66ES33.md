### Evidence Statement CG66ES33
In a German retrospective cohort study of 1,609 patients with Type 2 diabetes, hazard ratios
indicated that SMBG was associated with a 32% reduction in morbidity for combined
macrovascular (MI and stroke) and microvascular (foot amputation, blindness or end-stage renal
failure) non-fatal endpoints (HR=0.68, 95% CI 0.510.91, p=0.009). This was despite an increase
of microvascular events, and a 51% reduction in mortality over the observation period (HR=0.49,
95% CI 0.310.78, p=0.003) where mean follow-up was 6.5 years. In those not receiving insulin,
SMBG was associated with a 28% reduction in combined non-fatal endpoints (HR=0.72, 95% CI
0.520.99, p=0.0496) and a 42% reduction in mortality over the observation period (HR=0.58,
95% CI 0.350.96, p=0.035).44 Level 2+
