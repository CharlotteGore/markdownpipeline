### Evidence Statement CG66ES36
In a qualitative study performed in Scotland of newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetics, patients
reported strongly negative views of urine testing, particularly when they compared it with selfmonitoring
of blood glucose. Patients perceived urine testing as less convenient, hygienic and
accurate than self-monitoring of blood glucose. Most patients assumed that blood glucose
meters were given to those with a more advanced or serious form of diabetes. Patients often
interpreted negative urine results as indicating that they did not have diabetes.49
