### Evidence Statement CG66ES37
A Scottish qualitative study sought newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes patients perspectives on
the pros and cons of SMBG. Pros of self-monitoring:
  provides a heightened awareness of, and evidence of, the condition
  when readings are within advised guidelines and fluctuations are easily interpretable,
patients emphasise the positive role that monitoring has in their diabetes management. Low
readings are a high point giving personal gratification
  cultivates independence from health services and enhances self-regulation.
Cons of self-monitoring:
  potentially, self-monitoring can raise anxiety about readings
  blood glucose parameters were found to be problematic by patients when they felt they
were receiving contradictory information about upper thresholds or no guidance about
ideal parameters
  lack of awareness as to how to manage hyperglycaemia
  increased self-responsibility accompanied by increased self-blame and negative emotional
reactions to high glucose readings
  counter-intuitive readings could be sources of distress and anxiety, in some cases
adversely effecting adherence to diabetic regimens by promoting nihilistic attitudes
  healthcare professionals were not interested in readings.50
