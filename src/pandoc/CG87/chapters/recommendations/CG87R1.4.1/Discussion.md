### Discussion
The newer meta-analyses did not add significantly to the views expressed in the previous Type 2 diabetes guideline. The findings of the ROSSO study44 and the data from the large Kaiser Permanente cohorts 43 added considerable confidence to the view that SMBG was an integral part of effective patient education packages and enabled the effective use of many other therapies and lifestyle interventions. The view in the previous guideline that self-monitoring of plasma glucose is not a stand-alone intervention was endorsed. Concern was expressed over a number of issues surrounding the successful use of selfmonitoring, and recognised that its cost meant that it had to be effectively deployed. It should only be supported in the context of a provision of a package of care, including structured education, from a primary or secondary diabetes care team. The initial education should be provided by a properly trained and skilled professional with understanding of the problems of the technology. Also, the skills of people with diabetes in using the technology should be the subject of regular quality assurance (together with the devices) perhaps as part of the regular annual review process. Devices should be calibrated to plasma glucose levels in line with 2006 WHO recommendations.
