Self-monitoring is the only direct method by which a person with diabetes can be aware of their
level of control of blood glucose. It has utility when used with therapies of erratic effect, those
requiring considerable dose adjustment (notably insulin), and in those whose therapies put
them at risk of hypoglycaemia. More controversial, except for people using insulin, is the use of
self-monitoring to provide feedback on the impact of lifestyle measures on blood glucose
control, and as part of the overall educational package designed to enhance self-care. Indirect
monitoring using urine glucose tests is cheaper, but also delivers less information than plasma
glucose monitoring.
This section addresses the clinical question of the role of self-monitoring of plasma glucose in
people at different stages of the condition and on different therapies, and its integration with
other key processes of care such as patient education.
