### Evidence Statement CG66ES39
In the UKPDS (median follow-up 10.7 years), among overweight (54% with obesity)
participants allocated to intensive blood glucose control, metformin (N=342) showed a greater
benefit than chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or insulin (N=951) for any diabetes-related
outcomes, and for all-cause mortality. For other outcomes including diabetes-related death,
MI, stroke, peripheral vascular disease and microvascular, there were no significant differences
between both comparison arms. Level 1++
