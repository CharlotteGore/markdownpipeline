### Evidence Statement CG66ES40
In the same vein, the UKPDS found that overweight participants assigned to intensive blood
glucose control with metformin (N=342) showed a greater benefit than overweight patients on
conventional treatment (non-intensive blood glucose control, mainly with diet), (N=411), for
any diabetes-related outcomes, diabetes-related death, all-cause mortality, and MI. For the rest
of the outcomes such as stroke, peripheral vascular disease and microvascular, there were no
significant differences between both comparison arms. Level 1++
