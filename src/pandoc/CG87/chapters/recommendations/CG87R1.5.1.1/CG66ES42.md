### Evidence Statement CG66ES42
Overall, the evidence appraised suggested that monotherapy with metformin produced
significantly greater improvements in glycaemic control (i.e. HbA1c and FPG/fasting blood
glucose (FBG)) when it was compared with placebo, diet and sulfonylureas. Head-to-head
comparisons with other antidiabetic agents (i.e. alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones,
meglitinides and insulin) and extended-release formulations of metformin, failed to show more
benefit for glycaemic control than standard monotherapy with metformin. In addition metformin
used in combination with different doses of nateglinide produce significantly lower glycaemic
values than metformin monotherapy.
