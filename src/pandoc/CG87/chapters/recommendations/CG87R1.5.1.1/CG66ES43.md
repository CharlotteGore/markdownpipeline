### Evidence Statement CG66ES43
Overall, the evidence demonstrated a significant difference in terms of body weight/BMI
reduction favouring metformin monotherapy when compared with sulfonylureas, glitazones
and insulin therapies. Non-significant differences were found in head-to-head comparisons
between metformin against placebo, diet, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, meglitinides and
treatment with extend-release formulation of metformin. Combination of metformin and
different doses of nateglinide produced a significant reduction in body weight when compared
with metformin monotherapy. Level 1+
