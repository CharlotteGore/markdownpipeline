### Evidence Statement CG66HES8
In the cost-utility model there was a 77% probability that metformin would prove to be
cost-saving compared with a conventional policy.33 Sensitivity analyses were performed for
anti-diabetic therapy cost (50%); standard practice costs (50%); cost of complications
(50%); utility of one when free of complications; no treatment benefit and continuing benefit
beyond the trial. Metformin was consistently shown to be a cost-reducing intervention.
