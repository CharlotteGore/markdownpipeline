### Discussion
None of the newer evidence altered the priority given to metformin cited in the previous
guideline. Although the specific cardioprotective effects of metformin suggested by the UKPDS study were open to challenge from some of the very recent studies, this was not on the basis of strong outcome data. Large observational studies from Canada and Scotland111,112 appeared to support the widespread advantage of metformin over sulfonylureas, but the A Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial (ADOPT) study did not. The cardioprotective gains shown in the UKPDS andin the Scottish study far outweighed the concerns over lactic acidosis (provided renal function was adequate) in people with mild to moderate hepatic and cardiac disease. Nearly all the data related to overweight people, and there was little to guide metformin use in the normal weight person without extrapolation of the evidence. However, the overwhelming majority of people with Type 2 diabetes are overweight; in making this judgement however attention has to be paid
to differences between ethnic groups.
