### Evidence Statement CG66ES57
When repaglinide was compared with nateglinide in people with Type 2 diabetes previously
treated with diet and exercise:
repaglinide and nateglinide had similar postprandial glycaemic effects. However,
repaglinide was more effective than nateglinide in reducing HbA1c and FPG values
a greater weight gain (p=0.04) was seen in repaglinide-treated patients when compared to
nateglinide-treated patients
  hypoglycaemic events were more frequently reported by patients receiving repaglinide
(non-significant difference between the two groups).
