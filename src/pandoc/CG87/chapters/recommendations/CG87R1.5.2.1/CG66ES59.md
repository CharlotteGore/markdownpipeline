### Evidence Statement CG66ES59
When a modified-release version of gliclazide was compared with the immediate-release version of gliclazide in people with Type 2 diabetes who had been on diet control or ontreatment with oral hypoglycaemic agents:both versions were associated with significant reductions in HbA1c (non-significant difference between the two groups). FPG decreased significantly on gliclazide MR but not on gliclazide (non-significant difference between the two groups) no clinically significant changes were seen in terms of lipid profile (non-significant difference between the two groups) hypoglycaemic events were only reported by patients receiving gliclazide MR (9%) (nonsignificant difference was reported between the two groups).
