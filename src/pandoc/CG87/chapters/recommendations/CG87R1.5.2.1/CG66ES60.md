### Evidence Statement CG66ES60
When a modified-release version of gliclazide was compared with glimepiride in people with
Type 2 diabetes being treated with diet alone or with either metformin or alpha-glucosidase
inhibitors:both interventions were equally effective in terms of glycaemic control (alone or in
combination with metformin or alpha-glucosidase inhibitors) gliclazide MR had a better safety profile than glimepiride.
