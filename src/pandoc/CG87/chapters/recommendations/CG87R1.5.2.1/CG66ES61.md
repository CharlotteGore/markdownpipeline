### Evidence Statement CG66ES61
When insulin lispro was compared with glibenclamide in people with Type 2 diabetes who had been treated with oral antidiabetic (OAD) therapy, but not insulin: both regimes produced comparable effects in the control of glycaemia with respect to HbA1c. However, treatment with insulin lispro resulted in smaller postprandial blood glucose excursions compared to oral treatment with glibenclamide no significant differences were observed between the treatment groups regarding hypoglycaemic episodes and other AEs.
