### Evidence Statement CG66ES62
When repaglinide was compared with gliclazide (both drugs in combination with bedtime
NPH) in Type 2 diabetes patients inadequately controlled with oral hypoglycaemic therapy:
  both interventions were associated with significant reductions in HbA1c and FPG (nonsignificant
difference between the two groups) weight gain during the treatment period was similar in both groups no significant differences were observed between the treatment groups regarding
hypoglycaemic episodes and other AEs.
