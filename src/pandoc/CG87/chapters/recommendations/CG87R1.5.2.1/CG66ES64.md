### Evidence Statement CG66ES64
When glimepiride in combination with metformin was compared with monotherapy of each
drug in Type 2 diabetes patients inadequately controlled by metformin monotherapy:
  combination treatment was more effective than either drug alone in terms of glycaemic
control combination therapy was more effective than either drug in reducing TC levels
  metformin alone resulted in a significantly lower BMI than either glimepiride alone, or
the combination the incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes was significantly higher in the combinationtreatment group than in either of the monotherapy groups.
