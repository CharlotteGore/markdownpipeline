### Discussion
The evidence base for the insulin secretagogues was more extensive than ascertained for the parent guideline. However, in many of the papers in which they are compared to other drugs they were being used as the comparator therapy rather than the investigated therapy. New evidence did not lead to new conclusions about the role of these drugs in clinical management, either from the point of view of efficacy or safety. Sulfonylureas proved as efficacious as newer comparator therapies in reducing surrogate outcomes (principally HbA1c) highlighting that they still have a role in modern management of Type 2 diabetes. In the ADOPT study54 the sulfonylurea glibenclamide controlled HbA1c as effectively as rosiglitazone or metformin as monotherapy for the first 3 years, but persistence of glucose control after this time was worse.
Cardiovascular outcomes were, if anything, better with the sulfonylurea.
