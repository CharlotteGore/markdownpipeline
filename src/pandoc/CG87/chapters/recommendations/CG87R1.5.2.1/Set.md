The clinical questions concern the order with which these oral glucose-lowering medications
should be introduced and added to one another in different groups of people with Type 2
diabetes. Because such people vary in attributes (such as body weight) which can affect choice
of medication, and because some medication side effects can have consequences for aspects of
daily living (such as driving motor vehicles), blanket recommendations cannot be made for
everyone with Type 2 diabetes.
