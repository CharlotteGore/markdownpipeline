### Discussion
The newer evidence did not add significantly to the previous understanding of the role ofa-glucosidase inhibitors in the management of Type 2 diabetes, except in so far as the evidence suggested that the efficacy and intolerance problems were similar in oriental ethnic groups toEuropids. Lower glucose-lowering efficacy, a higher rate of intolerance and dropout fromtherapy, and relative expense compared to generic metformin and sulfonylureas were noted.However, hypoglycaemia is not a problem when this drug is used as monotherapy, though through glucose lowering it may enhance the hypoglycaemic potential of other medications.
