### Discussion
There was no strong published evidence that insulin pen injectors were a preferred option forinsulin injection, but in clinical practice this was not questionable. The studies comparing devices did not compare all devices, were inevitably unblinded, and were manufacturer sponsored in single centres for the most part. The issue of bias was real. It was considered thatsome devices preformed better than others, but also that this was generally known to regular prescribers. Prescribers should be fully familiar with the devices they were recommending; this would be difficult for all the devices available.
One injection device, the InnoLet, was not a pen injector, but was aimed more at people withphysical disabilities in manipulating injection systems. The studies were consistent with clinical experience in suggesting that this device was successful in enabling self-injection in somepeople who could not otherwise do it easily or reliably. Please refer to the Diabetes UK guidance for the issue of disposal of devices/sharps.
