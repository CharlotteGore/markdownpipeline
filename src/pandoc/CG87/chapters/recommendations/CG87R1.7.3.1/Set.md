Insulin was previously normally delivered from syringes, necessitating accurate measuring of insulin doses drawn up from insulin vials under suitably hygienic conditions. Modern peninjector devices obviate most of the problems of measuring up doses while avoiding most of the hygiene problems, and offer a convenient and safe means of carrying around injectionequipment. However, several models of injector are available, including some designed for those with visual and physical impairments. The clinical question addressed here was whether any particular pen-injector had an evidencebased advantage over any other, including groups of people with difficulty using such devices.
