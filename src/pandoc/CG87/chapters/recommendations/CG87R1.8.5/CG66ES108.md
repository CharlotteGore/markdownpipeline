### Evidence Statement CG66ES108
The study which considered verapamil + trandopril vs enalapril + hydrochlorothiazide identified
that HbA1c remained stable with verapamil + trandopril but increased with enalapril +
hydrochlorothiazide (baseline 5.961.25% to final 6.411.51%), difference between groups,
p=0.040.248 Crude blood glucose changes were 2369 mg/dl for verapamil + trandopril (16.8%
reduction) and 132 mg/dl (0.8% reduction) with enalapril + hydrochlorothiazide. The
percentage of participants with glycaemic control (<126 mg/dl) increased from 50% to 72% with
verapamil + trandopril, but did not change with enalapril + hydrochlorothiazide.248 Level 1++
