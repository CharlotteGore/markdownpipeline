### Evidence Statement CG66ES111
In summary, A2RB therapy was associated with greater benefits for Type 2 diabetes patients in terms of renal outcomes (e.g. progression to ESRD, doubling of serum creatinine, proteinuria) than treatment with placebo, CCB or sympatholytic agents. In addition, treatment with A2RB was also associated with a better metabolic and BP profile than sympatholytic therapy but nonsignificant differences were observed over those treated with CCB.
