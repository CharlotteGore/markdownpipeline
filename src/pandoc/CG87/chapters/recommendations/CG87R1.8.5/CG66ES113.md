### Evidence Statement CG66ES113
A post hoc analysis254 compared the incidence of hospitalisation for heart failure within three tertiles of baseline serum creatinine concentration (highest, 2.1 to 3.6 mg/dl; middle, 1.6 to
2.0 mg/dl; lowest, 0.9 to 1.6 mg/dl). The study reported that the crude incidence of first hospitalisations for heart failure was higher in the highest (16.4%) and middle (15.0%) tertiles
than in the lowest (11.1%) tertile (trend test across tertiles, p=0.02). The study concluded that losartan decreased the hospitalisations for heart failure by 50.2 and 45.1, in the highest and middle tertile, respectively but was associated with a non-significant increased risk (42.5%) of hospitalisations in the lowest tertile. Level 1+
