### Evidence Statement CG66ES115
A post hoc analysis254 compared the incidence of ESRD within three tertiles of baseline serum creatinine concentration (highest, 2.1 to 3.6 mg/dl; middle, 1.6 to 2.0 mg/dl; lowest, 0.9 to 1.6 mg/dl). The study reported that the observed crude incidence of ESRD was significantly higher in the highest (40.5%) and middle (19.3%) tertiles as compared with the lowest (7.3%) tertile (trend test across tertiles, p<0.0001).
The study concluded that losartan decreased the risk of ESRD by 24.6, 26.3, and 35.3% in highest, middle, and lowest tertiles respectively. Level 1+
