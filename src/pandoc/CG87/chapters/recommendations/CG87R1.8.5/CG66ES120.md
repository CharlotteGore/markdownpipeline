### Evidence Statement CG66ES120
A post hoc analysis of the IRMA study255 reported that after 2 years of follow-up UAER decreased by 34% (95% CI 8 to 53), and 60% (95% CI 46 to 70) in the irbesartan 150 mg and irbesartan 300 mg groups respectively (p<0.05 vs baseline). No significant reductions in UAER were found in patients receiving placebo. One month after withdrawal of irbesartan therapy, the same post hoc analysis255 found no significant increases in UAER in patients receiving placebo or irbesartan 150 mg when compared with baseline values. However, the study reported that UAER remained persistently reduced by 47% (95% CI 24 to 63) in the irbesartan 300 mg group (p<0.05 vs baseline). This persistent reduction in the irbesartan 300 mg group, as compared with baseline, was highly significantly different from irbesartan 150 mg (p<0.01). This difference occurred although the regain in GFR
between the two irbesartan groups were nearly identical. Level 1+
