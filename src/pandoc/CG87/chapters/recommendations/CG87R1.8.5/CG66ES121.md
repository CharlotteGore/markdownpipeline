### Evidence Statement CG66ES121
A post hoc analysis of the IRMA study255 found that after 2 years of treatment there were no
significant differences in mean arterial blood pressure between patients treated with placebo or
irbesartan (150 or 300 mg). However, 1 month after withdrawal of irbesartan therapy mean
arterial blood pressure was unchanged in the placebo group, but increased significantly in the
irbesartan groups to 1092 and 1082 in the 150 mg and 300 mg groups respectively (p<0.01).
