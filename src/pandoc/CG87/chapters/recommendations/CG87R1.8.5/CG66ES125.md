receiving irbesartan compared to amlodipine-treated patients (37% lower in the irbesartan
group than in the amlodipine group, p< 0.001). Non-significant differences in terms of progression to ESRD between irbesartan-treated patients and those receiving amlodipine (risk 23% lower in the irbesartan group p=0.07).
