### Evidence Statement CG66ES128
Another RCT252 which also compared treatment with valsartan and amlodipine, found that
after 24 weeks there was a significant reduction in UAER in patients receiving valsartan as
compared with those treated with amlodipine (p<0.001; 95% CI for ratio, 0.520 to 0.710). The
UAER at 24 weeks with valsartan was 56% (95% CI, 49.6 to 63.0) of baseline, equivalent to a
44% reduction. The UAER for amlodipine at week 24 was 92% (95% CI, 81.7 to 103.7) of
baseline, a reduction of only 8%. Level 1++
