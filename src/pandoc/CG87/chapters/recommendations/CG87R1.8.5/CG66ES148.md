### Evidence Statement CG66ES148
Only the study comparing two beta-blockers reported on metabolic outcomes. The study considering carvedilol and metoprolol found that carvedilol treatment had no HbA1c changes from baseline while metoprolol increased HbA1c. The mean difference was 0.12%, p=0.006. More participants withdrew due to worsening glycaemic control with metoprolol (16/737, 2.2%) than with carvedilol (3/498, 0.6%), p=0.04.260 Level 1++
