### Evidence Statement CG66ES149
The study comparing COER verapamil with atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide261 reported that participants assigned COER verapamil withdrew more often due to adverse signs or symptoms compared with those assigned atenolol of hydrochlorothiazide (p=0.02); the most common reason was constipation (216 in the COER verapamil compared with 28 in the atenolol of hydrochlorothiazide group). However, fewer participants assigned COER verapamil (N=115) atenolol of hydrochlorothiazide withdrew because of poor BP control compared with those  assigned atenolol of hydrochlorothiazide (N=207) (p<0.001 by log-rank). Level 1+
