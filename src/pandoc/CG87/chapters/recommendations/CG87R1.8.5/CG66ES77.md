### Evidence Statement CG66ES77
The RENAAL study231 demonstrated that for SBP the baseline level of 160179 mmHg or
=180 mmHg compared with less than 130 mmHg had a significantly greater risk of reaching the
primary endpoint (time to doubling of serum creatinine, end stage renal disease (ESRD) or
death), risk of ESRD or death and risk of ESRD alone. Kaplan-Meier curve also showed that for
those with a baseline SBP =140 compared with <140 mmHg there was a significantly higher risk
of reaching the primary endpoint and risk of ESRD alone. For achieved SBP those who had a SBP
of 140 to =180 mmHg compared with less than 130 mmHg had a significantly greater risk of
reaching the primary endpoint; for those with an achieved SBP of 140159 mmHg compared
with less than 130 mmHg there was a significantly greater risk of ESRD or death and ESRD alone.
For achieved DBP those with a DBP from 90 to =100 mmHg compared with those with an
achieved DBP of <70 mmHg had a significantly greater risk of reaching the primary endpoint
(time to doubling of serum creatinine, ESRD or death), risk of ESRD or death and risk of ESRD
alone231 (see table 12.3.1). Level 1+
