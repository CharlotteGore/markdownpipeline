### Evidence Statement CG66ES79
The further analysis from the IDNT study identified that baseline BP correlated significantly with
doubling SCr or ESRD and that 36% of those with baseline SBP >170 mmHg compared with 18%
for those with baseline SBP <145 mmHg reached renal endpoint. Following correction for
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) each 20 mmHg
decrease in SBP was associated with a 30% reduction in the risk of a renal event. Though it should
be noted that while there was an increasing risk for reaching a renal endpoint with seated SBP,
those with SBP <120 mmHg were not substantially better than those between 120130 mmHg.228
