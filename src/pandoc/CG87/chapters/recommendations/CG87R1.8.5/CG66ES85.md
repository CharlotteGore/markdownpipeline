### Evidence Statement CG66ES85
A systematic review showed that for the outcome stroke, there was no evidence of differences
in the effects of the treatment regimens between patients with and without diabetes except in
the comparison that included A2RB-based regimens. In this comparison, A2RB provided lesser
protection to patients with diabetes compared with those without diabetes (see table 12.5.1).234
