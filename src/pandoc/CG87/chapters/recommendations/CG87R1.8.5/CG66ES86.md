### Evidence Statement CG66ES86
For the outcomes coronary heart disease (CHD) and heart failure, the review did not show
differences between patients with and without diabetes for any comparison, again except for the
comparison that included A2RB. Diabetic patients treated with A2RB experienced a
significantly greater protection compared to those without diabetes for the outcome heart
failure.234
