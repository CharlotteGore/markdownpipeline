### Evidence Statement CG66ES89
Overall, the evidence appraised showed no significant differences in terms of CV outcomes
when treatment with ACEI was compared with other antihypertensive therapies or with
placebo. ACEI also failed to demonstrate superiority over other agents on the basis of BP
lowering power (unless combination therapy is compared with monotherapy). However, the
evidence suggested that treatment with ACEI is related to greater benefits in terms of renal
outcomes in patients with Type 2 diabetes as compared with other BP lowering agents.
