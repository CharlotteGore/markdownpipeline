### Evidence Statement CG66ES98
A post hoc analysis of the BENEDICT246 study considered the impact on BP control and ACEI therapy on new-onset microalbumuniuria. Baseline SBP, DBP, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and pulse pressure did not predict the onset of microalbuminuria. Participants who developed microalbuminuria had significantly lower reductions in SBP than those who did not develop microalbuminuria (7.911.5 vs 10.611.9, p<0.05). This study also identified that those with followupBP below the medians or with BP reduction above the medians were more frequently on ACEtherapy (particularly trandopirl + verapamil) and less frequently on concomitant treatment withdiuretics, beta-blockers or CCBs.246 Level 1+
