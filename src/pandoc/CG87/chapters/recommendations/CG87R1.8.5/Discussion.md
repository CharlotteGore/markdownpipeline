### Discussion
The GDG noted the problems in assigning BP lowering targets in this area, and in particular the  problem setting a cut-off where the evidence suggests the lower the blood pressure the better (without adverse effects) difficulties of achieving any reasonable target in some people individual targets that should logically vary with individual risk arbitrary dichotomy that arises immediately above and below any target level. The results of some RCTs suggested that SBP well into the normal range (below usual target values) was both achievable and associated with benefit in people with Type 2 diabetes, consistent with epidemiological evidence from other studies. In some other studies tight BP control seemed difficult to achieve, consistent with the groups clinical experience. This led the group to take a simple risk approach centered on a target level of <140/80 mmHg for most people with Type 2 diabetes, and <130/80 mmHg for those at more particular risk. The latter group included people with raised albumin excretion rate (AER) (microalbuminuria or worse), eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2, those with retinopathy, and those with prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). The concern that more active prevention was being targeted at those who had already developed end-organ damage was recognised, but it was noted that for both microalbuminuria (chapter 16) and early retinopathy (chapter 17) the recommendations on annual surveillance meant that markers of damage would be detected many years before ill health ensued.
