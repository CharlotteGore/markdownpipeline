People with Type 2 diabetes are at high cardiovascular (CV) risk, high risk of diabetes eye
damage, and high risk of renal disease. These adverse outcomes are known to be reduced by
improved blood pressure (BP) control, which can be used to lower the risk of stroke, MI,
blindness and renal failure.226 Some other forms of diabetes microvascular damage, including
peripheral nerve damage, are known to be associated with higher BP.227 BP lowering is likely to
be highly cost-effective in people with Type 2 diabetes, more so than in the general population.
A number of clinical questions then face the person with diabetes and their advisors, these include:
  at what levels of BP to initiate therapy whether, and to what extent, those levels should be influenced by particular risk factors(in particular those involved in renal disease)
  what level of BP to aim for, and whether that should be modified by the presence of renal,
eye, or macrovascular damage, what lifestyle measure are effective and cost-effective in lowering BP
 what pharmacological interventions are effective and cost-effective in BP lowering
  how choice of agent might be modified by the presence of end organ damage.
Lifestyle measures (explored elsewhere) and monotherapy medication are known to have
limited efficacy in lowering BP. Additional clinical questions arise over:
  the combinations of medications to be used after first-line therapy
  considerations including synergies of action, side effects of some combinations, and cost.
