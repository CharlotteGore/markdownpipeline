### Evidence Statement CG66ES156
When using both risk calculation methods similar proportions were assigned, 10-year scores less than 15% (Framingham 27.3% and UKPDS 25.7%). However, the UKPDS risk engine assigned a 10-year score over 30% to 187 (43.7%) of the study participants as compared with only 88 (20.5%) when derived from Framingham.
