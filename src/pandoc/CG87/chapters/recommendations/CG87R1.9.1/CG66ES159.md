### Evidence Statement CG66ES159
Overall, the UKPDS risk engine was found to calculate a significantly higher mean 10-year risk (UKPDS vs JBS, 21.5 vs 18.3%, p<0.0001) with the mean difference of 3.2% (95% CI 2.73.8).
However, both methods identified approximately 65% of patients with Type 2 diabetes who would require primary prevention intervention and therefore have comparable accuracy in identifying these high-risk patients.
