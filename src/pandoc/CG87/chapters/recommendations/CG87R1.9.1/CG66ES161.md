### Evidence Statement CG66ES161
Both methods identified similar proportions of patients with CHD risk of at least 15% over 10 years. However, the main differential feature found between the two methods was the tendency of the UKPDS risk engine to identify significantly more patients in the high-risk category (>30%) in comparison with JBS (p<0.001). (See table 13.4.)
