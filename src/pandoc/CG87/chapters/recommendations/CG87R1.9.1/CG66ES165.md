### Evidence Statement CG66ES165
The 10-year fatal CVD event rate (95% CI) observed in UKPDS was 7.4% (6.58.3).Framingham underestimated this by 32% with an AR of 5.0%, SCORE overestimated risk by 18% (AR 8.7%) whereas DECODE (AR 6.6%) yielded an acceptable estimate. For males, only SCORE provided a reasonable estimate. In females, only Framinghamperformed well. For Caucasians (N=3,207), the 7.9% (6.79.0) observed event rate was underestimated by 34% using Framingham (AR 5.2%), overestimated by 19% using SCORE (AR 9.4%), and estimated appropriately by DECODE (AR 7.1%)
