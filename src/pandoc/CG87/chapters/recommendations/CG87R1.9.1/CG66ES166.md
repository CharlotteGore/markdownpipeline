### Evidence Statement CG66ES166
The 10-year fatal CHD event rate (95% CI) observed in UKPDS was 6.3% (5.57.1). Framingham underestimated this (AR 4.3%) while SCORE provided a reasonable estimate (AR 5.7%). Both equations provided reliable estimates for females but not males. For Caucasians, the observed rate of 7.2% (6.38.1) was underestimated by both Framingham (4.6%) and SCORE (6.2%).
