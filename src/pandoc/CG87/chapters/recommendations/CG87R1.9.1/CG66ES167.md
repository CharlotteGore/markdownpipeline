### Evidence Statement CG66ES167
A study274 reported results from a total of 74 validation exercises which were conductedinvolving different treatments and outcomes in 18 clinical trials (10 of which were not used to build the model).* Level 3For 71 of the 74 exercises there were no statistically significant differences between the results calculated by the model and the results observed in the trial. Overall, the correlation coefficient for all 74 exercises is r=0.99. If the outcomes in the control group and the absolute differences between the control and treated groups are compared for model and trial, the correlation coefficient is r=0.99. Focusing specifically on the absolute differences in the outcomes, which determines the number neededto treat, the correlation coefficient is r=0.97. For the 10 trials that were not used to build the model, the correlation coefficient is also r=0.99.
