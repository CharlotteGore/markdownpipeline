Nearly all people with Type 2 diabetes are at high cardiovascular (CV) risk   high enough to justify
statin therapy without further assessment.273 Others are at more extreme risk.273 Other therapies
in addition to cholesterol-modifying drugs used to ameliorate CV risk include blood glucose
lowering, blood pressure (BP) lowering, and anti-platelet therapies (see recommendations in these
areas), together with lifestyle measures. Logically the intensity with which these therapies are used
should be determined in part by the level of risk. To a limited extent this can be assessed clinically
by summation of presence of risk factors (high waist circumference, low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C) level, HbA1c, BP, smoking, family history of premature vascular disease,
ethnic group, abnormal serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride
(TG)) or the presence of particular risk factors (microalbuminuria, previous CV event). However,
many of these variables are continuous distributions so it makes sense to ask whether tools are
available that make full use of the data which could be made available from their measurement. As
diabetes itself is a risk factor, any such approach would have to be diabetes specific. 
The clinical questions addressed were whether any risk calculator (risk engine) or risk chart,
specifically designed for people with diabetes, gave valid and useful assessments of CV risk in
people with diabetes, and in what circumstances they might be used.
