### Evidence Statement CG66ES169
The lipid-lowering therapy meta-analysis showed that the RR reductions were similar for both primary and secondary prevention.282 However, the average absolute risk reduction was more than twice as high for those with coronary artery disease (secondary prevention) than for those without it (primary prevention). Primary prevention trials  fixed effects analysis due to level of heterogeneity (p=0.18). The pooled RR for CV events with lipid-lowering therapy was 0.78 (0.67 to 0.89), with number needed to be treated (NNT) for benefit of 34.5 (for 4.3 years). Secondary prevention analysis  random effects analysis as there was substantial between study heterogeneity (p=0.03). The pooled RR for CV events with lipid-lowering therapy was similar to that for primary prevention 0.76 (0.59 to 0.93), with NNT for benefit for of 13.8 (for 4.9 years). The authors concluded that target cholesterol levels and the effectiveness of dose titration (or the use of multiple agents) have not been rigorously examined. Most studies compared a lipid lowering drug with placebo but did not evaluate the effect of reaching specific cholesterol levels. Level 1++
