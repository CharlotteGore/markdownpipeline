### Evidence Statement CG66ES170
One RCT291 found that over the 5 years of double-blind treatment, the incidence of a major CV event* was significantly lower in patients receiving atorvastatin 80 mg than in those receiving atorvastatin 10 mg. This represented a 25% reduction in the risk of major CV events in favour of the high-dose group (p>0.026). This trend was observed across all quintiles of patient age and duration of diabetes and in patients with HbA1c =7% and A1C >7%. Level 1++
