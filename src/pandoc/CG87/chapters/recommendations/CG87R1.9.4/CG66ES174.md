### Evidence Statement CG66ES174
A post hoc analysis of the CARDS trial289 analysed the time between initiation of atorvastatin 10 mg and the appearance of significant differences in the incidence of CV events when compared to placebo. The study demonstrated that by 1 year of follow-up the estimate of the treatment effect of atorvastatin 10 mg on the primary endpoint of major CV events was already at its final values of 37% reduction, and by 18 months the CI did not include unity. Level 1++
