### Evidence Statement CG66ES186
The double-blind, multicentre FIELD study with N=9,795 participants compared fenofibrate 200 mg/day with a placebo in a Type 2 diabetes population, over a 5-year duration. At 4 months, 1 year, 2 years and at completion of the study there were significant decreases in TC, LDL-C and TG levels and increases in HDL-C levels with fenofibrate compared with placebo. For study participants who started other lipid-lowering therapy during the study (total N=2,720, N=944 placebo group and N=1,776 fenofibrate group) they showed smaller changes in lipid levels, but the significance between the groups remained p<0.05 at 2 years. At study close the changes remained significant for TC and TGs between the groups; however, the changes in LDL-C and HDL-C were NS. There were small percentages (0.5 with placebo and 0.8% with fenofibrate) of possible serious
adverse drug reactions. Four participants had rhabdomyolysis which fully resolved (N=3 with
fenofibrate and N=1 with placebo). Rates of new cancer diagnosis were similar between groups.GI events were the most frequently reported event, these were noted with N=975 (20%) of the fenofibrate and N=927 (19%) of the placebo group. Level 1++
