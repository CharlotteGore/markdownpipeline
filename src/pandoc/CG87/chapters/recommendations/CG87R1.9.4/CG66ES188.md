### Evidence Statement CG66ES188
This study compared fenofibrate 200 mg/day and atorvastatin 20 mg/day monotherapiescompared with the combination of fenofibrate and atorvastatin, with N=120 participants.296
Treatment goals
The treatment goals for LDL-C (2.4 mmol/l), TGs (2.6 mmol/l) and HDL-C (1.2 mmol/l) were reached in significantly more (reached by 97.5%, 100% and 60% respectively, p<0.05) participants for the combination of fenofibrate and atorvastatin than the monotherapies. The fenofibrate group compared with the atorvastatin group reached the treatment goals in a significantly higher percentage for HDL-C (30% vs 17.5%) and TGs (92.5% vs 75%), while the reverse was true for LDL-C with 80% of the atorvatstatin reaching the treatment goal compared with 5% of the fenofibrate group. 
Lipids
The combination treatment reduced the TC, TGs and LDL-C significantly more than the atorvastatin or the fenofibrate as monotherapies. This combination also significantly increased
HDL-C compared with atorvastatin monotherapy but not compared with fenofibrate.
Adverse events
There were no significant AEs reported in this study. Level 1+
