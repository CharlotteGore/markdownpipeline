### Evidence Statement CG66ES190
This multicentre study incorporated both a double-blind, fixed-dose phase and an open-label titrating dose phase, N=216.297 Fixed dose: the 6-week fixed-dose phase had placebo, rosuvastatin 5 mg and rosuvastatin 10 mg groups.  There were significant decreases for both rosuvastatin 5 mg and 10 mg groups compared with increases with placebo in TC (36.6%, 31.4% vs 1.1%, p<0.001) and TGs (24.5%, 29.5% vs 4.7%, p<0.001) and compared with decreases in LDL-C levels with placebo (40.7%, 45.8% vs 0.6%, p<0.001). At week 6, 77.4% of those in the rosuvastatin 10 mg group had reached the LDL-C goal of <100 mg/dl, compared with 8.3% of those receiving placebo.
