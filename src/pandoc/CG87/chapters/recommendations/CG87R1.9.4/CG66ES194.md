The atorvastatin and combination groups had significantly greater reductions in LDL-C than the gemfibrozil group (reductions NS for atorvastatin vs combination). For TG levels the gemfibrozil and combination groups had significantly greater reductions than the atorvastatin group (reductions NS for gemfibrozil vs combination). There were NS differences between the monotherapies and the combination treatment for HDL-C levels.
