Nearly all people with Type 2 diabetes are at high cardiovascular (CV) risk. Epidemiologicallythat excess risk is independently associated with their hyperglycaemia together with high blood pressure (BP) and dyslipidaemia, the last typically the low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and raised triglyceride (TG) levels found as components of the metabolic syndrome.280 Studies have suggested that people with Type 2 diabetes without declared cardiovascular disease (CVD) are at as high a risk of a CVD event as someone without diabetes with declared CVD.273 While this is disputed by other studies, it still leaves individuals with Type 2 diabetes as nearly always in the high CVD risk category, and accordingly it has been usual to manage them actively as if for secondary rather than primary prevention of CVD. Nevertheless, in a few people with Type 2 diabetes the clinical phenotype is not that associated with high CV risk, albeit these people being generally remarkable for not being overweight nor having features of the metabolic syndrome, and being insulin sensitive. More importantly people with Type 2 diabetes who have declared CVD are at much higher risk (>1.5 2.6) of further events or CV death as people with CVD without diabetes.273 Such extreme risk would appear to justify more intensive management than usually offered to someone who has, for example, had a heart attack.  The management of CV risk through glucose lowering, BP lowering, and anti-platelet therapy is dealt with elsewhere in this guideline. This chapter deals with lipid-lowering therapy; dietary modification also being dealt with in a separate chapter. Paradoxically, although low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are not particularly raised in people with Type 2 diabetes compared to the background population, the opportunity to lower risk through lipid management is currently greatest through drugs which lower LDL-C, principally the statins.Nevertheless, a variety of other lipid modifying drugs are available and will be considered in turn.
